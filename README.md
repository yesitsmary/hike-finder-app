# Hike Finder API

This project is a Flask-based machine learning API that predicts the energy level (mood) of a hiking trail based on its description. It uses a logistic regression model trained on TF-IDF features and an elevation gain indicator.

## üöÄ Features

- Text classification using TF-IDF + Logistic Regression
- Binary flag for elevation gain using regex
- Flask API to predict energy level: Relaxed, Chill, Adventurous, or Challenging
- Dockerized for easy deployment
- Tested locally with `curl` and ready for deployment

## üß† Model Overview

- **Text input:** Trail descriptions from the National Park Service API
- **Preprocessing:** Strip HTML, detect elevation gain
- **Features:** TF-IDF (1000 unigrams) + `hasElevation` binary flag
- **Model:** Multiclass Logistic Regression
- **Classes:** `Relaxed`, `Chill`, `Adventurous`, `Challenging`

## üê≥ Docker Build Instructions

This section explains how to build and run the Flask-based Hiking Finder API using Docker and optionally push it to Docker Hub.

### 1. Clone repo and change directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hike-finder-api.git
cd hike-finder-api
```
*Downloads project folder from Github and moves you into the folder*

### 2. Build and run Docker container
```bash
docker build -t hike-finder-api .
```
*Builds the Docker image from the Dockerfile and tags it as hike-finder-api*
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 hike-finder-api
```
*Runs the app in a Docker container and makes it accessible at http://localhost:8080*

### 3. Tag and push to Docker Hub (Optional)
```bash
docker tag hike-finder-api yourusername/hike-finder-api:latest
```
*Adds a tag that points to the Docker Hub repository*

```bash
docker push yourusername/hike-finder-api:latest
```
*Pushes the image to Docker Hub for deployment*

### 4. Send a test prediction
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/predict \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"longDescription": "This trail includes an elevation gain of 1,500 feet over rocky terrain."}'
```
*Ensures the API works correctly*
