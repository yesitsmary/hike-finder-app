The Coast Trail then heads inland and drops into a small valley before ascending switchbacks up the other side. Climb over a pass, and hike past a number of small ponds before reaching Bass Lake after 2.8 miles (4.5 km) of hiking. In another 0.6 miles (1 km) arrive at a view of Pelican Lake. Continuing on 0.8 miles (1.3 km) leads to the junction with the Ocean Lake Loop Trail. Stay right to remain on the Coast Trail as it heads a bit further inland through coastal scrub and forest, or turn left on to the Ocean Lake Loop Trail, which drops initially to pass by Ocean Lake, but then climbs steeply to reach the top of some coastal bluffs with views looking up and down the shoreline. Both routes reconnect after 1.1 miles (1.7 km). After this point you'll be back on the Coast Trail for a final 0.2 miles (0.3 km) to Wildcat Campground. From Bear Valley Trailhead Follow the relatively flat Bear Valley Trail south  for 3.1 miles (5 km) to the Glen Trail. Turn left onto the Glen Trail and begin climbing up the side of a ridge. After 0.6 miles (1 km), keep right to stay on the Glen Trail. After another 0.4 miles (0.6 km) keep left to stay on the Glen Trail.

Hikers may wish to shorten their hike by 0.7 miles (1.2 km) by following the Greenpicker Trail to the top of the ridge, but be forewarned that the Greenpicker Trail is steeper than the Stewart Trail. Alternatively, continue on the Stewart Trail as it switchbacks 2.6 miles (4.2 km) up the side of the ridge to Fir Top, the highest location (1324 ft/404 m) along the southern end of Inverness Ridge. Due to the dense Douglas fir forests, there are no far-reaching views. Hikers on the Greenpicker Trail can return to the Stewart Trail at this location. Continue straight on the Stewart Trail as it descends 2.7 miles (4.3 km) from the top of the ridge to Wildcat Campground.

Many trails/routes lead to Coast Campground, Santa Maria Beach, and Sculptured Beach, but the most commonly used routes are: from the Limantour Beach South Parking Lot via Limantour Beach; from the Laguna Trailhead via the Laguna and Fire Lane Trails; and from the Coast Trailhead via the Coast Trail. The northern 2.8 miles (4.5 km) of the Coast Trail from the Coast Trailhead to Coast Campground is open to bicycles. Visit our Hike to Sculptured Beach page for in-depth descriptions on these three routes. These route descriptions alone are not a substitute for a trail map. Print out the park's South District trail map (3,422 KB PDF) before your visit, or pick one up at a visitor center on your way.. Always check current conditions before heading out into the park and familiarize yourself with park regulations. Please practice Leave No Trace principles. Visit the park's Hiking at Point Reyes National Seashore page for hiking tips and information about trail etiquette and safety. Visit the park's Trail Advisories and Closures page for current information about closed trails, trails blocked by trees, or other temporary hazards or advisories. Please take note! The Sculptured Beach Trail was decommisioned in 2023. Many social media posts, websites, and guide books may still reference the Sculptured Beach Trail. This is NOT a maintained trail, and poses many hazards to off-trail hikers—poison oak and crumbling and eroding cliffs. Visitors who use this unmaintained trail may endanger themselves and rescuers, and damage park resources. The National Park Service strongly advises visitors against using this unmaintained route. Please use the recommended routes described on our Hike to Sculptured Beach page to visit the Sculptured Beach, Secret Beach, and Skylight Cave. Park Regulations  Glass: Glass containers are prohibited on all Point Reyes Beaches.

Hiking Directions to Sculptured Beach via Santa Maria Beach Please visit our Hike to Sculptured Beach page for in-depth descriptions on how to get to Sculptured Beach. Santa Maria Beach Santa Maria Beach is a one-mile-long (1.6-km-long) beach backed by sandstone bluffs that stretches from the southeast end of Limantour Beach to Santa Maria Creek. Coast Campground sits above the middle section of Santa Maria Beach where the seasonal Jaybird Creek descends to Drakes Bay. (Please note: Jaybird Creek is mislabeled as Santa Maria Creek on Google Maps.) The perennial Santa Maria Creek marks the boundary between the sandy Santa Maria Beach and the rocky Sculptured Beach. There is usually more than enough sand on Santa Maria Beach to safely walk along it without needing to worry about tide levels; the waves rarely reach the base of the bluffs unless there is a high surf warning or very high tides during winter storms. Sculptured Beach Sculptured Beach is a 0.75-mile-long (1.2-kilometer-long) stretch of coastline along which many rocky outcrops rise above sandy sections of beach and extend out into Drakes Bay. At higher tides, waves reach the base of the naturally sculpted cliffs for which the beach is named. Therefore, it is only safe to visit Sculptured Beach at low tides. About 0.5 miles (0.8 km) southeast of Santa Maria Creek, a larger, finger-like rocky headland extends into the bay, blocking further passage unless one climbs onto the relative low headland near the base of the bluff. This ascent is not to challenging. The Drop/Climb On the other side of the headland is a much steeper, approximately eight-foot (2.4-meter) drop onto a small pocket beach. Do not descend here unless you are certain you can make it back up. After descending onto the pocket beach, you will walk on the sand between the bluff and a second finger-like rocky headland that has been severed from the bluff. (Or…there is a sea cave/tunnel that waves have carved through this outcrop. At very low tides, it might be possible to walk from one side of this headland through to the other without getting your feet wet. Please be careful only to step on sand and barren rock and not on intertidal organisms.) Once past this headland, you'll walk around the base of a stubby headland and reach a third finger-like headland after another 150 feet (45 meters) or so. This headland has a short tunnel through which you will pass. From here, your route is unobstructed sand for the next ~1,000 feet (~300 meters), until you get to the headland that separates Sculptured Beach from Secret Beach. And this is the location where planning, timing, tides, and surf conditions are most critical. The Keyhole At the south end of Sculptured Beach is a headland that extends into Drakes Bay. The water around its base is relatively deep and it is never safe to walk/swim around it. However, there is a keyhole/tunnel that has been eroded through the headland that is large enough for people to pass through. But, safe passage through this keyhole is only possible when the tide is very low, i.e., a negative tide, sometimes necessitating a low of -1 foot. Be sure to check the tide predictions for Point Reyes before you visit. Please watch your step as you pass through the keyhole, both for your safety—the rocks may be covered by algae and can be very slippery—as well as for the survival of intertidal marine organisms—only walk on barren rock. There are two other variables besides the tides that come into play at this location: 1) how much sand is on the beach around the keyhole; and 2) the height of the surf. The more sand there is, the higher the tide can be without potentially having to wade through water. The less sand there is, the lower the tide will need to be. Usually, there is more sand on the beach around the keyhole during the summer and fall and less sand during the winter and spring. Somewhat similarly, the smaller the surf, the higher the tide can be without potentially having to wade through water. The bigger the surf, the lower the tide will need to be. And bigger surf increases the hazards of being hit and battered by a large wave while passing through the keyhole. If there are Beach Hazard Statements or High Surf Advisories or Warnings (or worse) in effect, do not attempt to pass through the keyhole. Once you make it through the keyhole, you've arrived at the north end of Secret Beach. Please watch you step as you cross the tidepool zone to reach the sandy section of the beach. Secret Beach and Skylight Cave Secret Beach is 0.85 miles (1.4 km) in length. Sheer bluffs run the length of the beach, all the way to Point Resistance at its south end. In numerous locations, small faults and twisted and contorted layers of rock may be viewed, along with some small sea caves. The largest of Secret Beach's sea caves formed at its northern end. But, at some time in the distant past, the roof of the sea cave, but not its ocean-facing wall, collapsed, forming a large sinkhole-like depression in the coastal bluffs. This feature is labeled as Skylight Cave on an early park map used by the park's trail crew. Usually, one may enter Skylight Cave through a small tunnel-like entrance about 130 feet (40 meters) to the east of the keyhole. Sometimes, the sand has been scoured away from the entrance and one can walk upright through the tunnel. Other times, sand has built up at the entrance and one may need to crawl on hands and knees (or even on one's belly). And sometimes during the summer and fall, the entrance may be blocked by sand. Be careful as you pass through the tunnel not to hit your head on the tunnel's rocky ceiling. Timing Your Visit If you are going no further than Skylight Cave, you will want to pass south through the keyhole no later than about 15 minutes before low tide so that you will have about 30 minutes before you need to pass north through the keyhole and have the same approximate tide level as when you passed to the south. If you plan to walk the entire length of Secret Beach to Point Resistance, you will want to pass south through the keyhole no later than 30 minutes before low tide. The lower the tide, the longer the window of opportunity will be, e.g., the tide might be low enough to pass through the keyhole an hour before to an hour after very low tides.",Hiking,210.0,Adventurous,0,"Distance: 5–5.6 miles (8–9 km) roundtrip from Limantour Beach parking lots 6.1 miles (9.8 km) roundtrip from the Laguna Trailhead 8.1 miles (13 km) roundtrip from the Coast Trailhead Skylight Cave is a sea cave with a collapsed ceiling at the north end of Secret Beach, which is located within the Phillip Burton Wilderness along the eastern shore of Drakes Bay. Even though Skylight Cave is only 2.5 miles (3.8 km) from the closest parking lot at Limantour Beach, it is usually only safe to visit at tides that measure -1 (negative one) foot or lower.

Hike the Rift Zone Trail,1-4 Hours,"Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall",Point Reyes National Seashore,CA,https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/hike-the-rift-zone-trail.htm,"Explore the floor of a valley that follows the San Andreas Fault, passing through meadows and woods between Bear Valley and Five Brooks. This hike can begin at either the Bear Valley Trailhead or the Five Brooks Trailhead. Allow about 10 minutes to drive from Bear Valley to Five Brooks.","Distance: 2 to 8.6 miles (3 to 13.8 km) roundtrip Explore the floor of a valley that follows the San Andreas Fault, passing through meadows and woods. Evidence of former earthquakes are rather subtle, coming in the form of diverted streams, shutter ridges, and sag ponds that most visitors overlook. One will only find a fresh scar on the surface of the ground if there has been a large earthquake recently; the last one was on April 18, 1906. Start at either the Bear Valley Trailhead at the trail's north end, or the Five Brooks Trailhead at its south. The description below proceeds from north to south. From the southwestern corner of the Bear Valley Trailhead, the Rift Zone Trail heads east through a meadow for 0.3 miles (0.5 km) before crossing a bridge over the tree-lined Bear Valley Creek. Those paying attention may notice that the creek is deflected by a low ridge just upstream from this location—one of the first indications one will encounter of the valley's seismic history. After crossing the bridge, the trail climbs up and over a partially wooded shutter ridge and then crosses through another meadow, which, until relatively recently, served as a cattle pasture. After another 0.5 miles (0.8 km) [0.8 miles (1.3 km) from Bear Valley], the trail crosses the access road for the Vedanta Society Retreat. The trail beyond this road is only open to the general public from 8 am until 2 hours before sunset. Please be sure to close the gates after you pass through. South of the road, the trail passes through private property for the next couple miles (few kilometers); please treat both the private land and public park lands with respect and practice Leave No Trace principles. Take only pictures and leave only footprints. From the access road, the trail turns south and passes through two active (and sometimes muddy) cattle pastures. The trail may be difficult to distinguish from the cattle paths, but, so long as the cows haven't pushed them over, there should be posts with small signs along the designated path to help you find your way. After 0.3 miles (0.5 km), the trail pass through a gate in the fence separating the pastures. Again, please be sure to close any gates you open. The trail then turns south-southwest for another 0.3 miles (0.5 km) before heading west through a gate near the southwest corner of the pasture. Follow the trail ~235 feet (~70 m) west between the fence line and the tree line. Pass through the smaller gate to the left (closest to the tree line) and keep to the left to stay on the Rift Zone Trail, which intersects in this immediate area with ranch roads and fences. From this junction, the trail (an old ranch road) heads south a bit before bending south-southeast to travel between a fenced meadow on the west and trees to the east. After another 0.2 miles (0.3 km), the trail enters the woods. After another hundred yards/meters or so into the woods [1.8 miles (2.9 km) from Bear Valley], one will encounter a shallow sag pond. Young redwoods grow east of the trail to the south of the pond for a few hundred yards. Beyond the pond, the terrain becomes more hilly, but the trail should be easier to follow with only a couple junctions with other ranch roads that are rarely used (and are closed to the general public). Follow the Rift Zone Trail through woods and a few meadows until you reach the Five Brooks Horse Camp, located 4.0 miles (6.4 km) from Bear Valley Trailhead. The southernmost 0.2 miles (0.3 kilometers) of the Rift Zone Trail are closed due a severe washout of the trail. Due to the presence of these hazardous conditions, use of the trail by anyone is not safe until these hazards are mitigated. Please do not use this section of trail until the trail has been repaired. There is a detour route available:  To get from the the Rift Zone Trail at the north end of the Horse Camp to Five Brooks Trailhead:  head south on the Rift Zone Trail through the Horse Camp for 460 feet (140 m) to the Stewart Trail-Horse Camp Connector Trail/Road; turn right and follow the Stewart Trail-Horse Camp Connector Trail/Road for ~0.3 miles (0.5 km) past the horse camp's bath house and up the hill past the water tank to the Stewart Trail; follow the Stewart Trail south ~0.4 miles (0.7 km) to the Five Brooks Trailhead.   To get from Five Brooks Trailhead to the Rift Zone Trail:  follow the Stewart Trail north ~0.4 miles (0.7 km) to its junction with the Stewart Trail-Horse Camp Connector Trail/Road; turn right and follow the Stewart Trail-Horse Camp Connector Trail/Road for ~0.3 miles (0.5 km) down the hill past a water tank and the horse camp's bath house to the junction with the Rift Zone Trail; turn left onto the Rift Zone Trail and head north through the horse camp for 460 feet (140 m) to a gap in the split rail fence.

Start from the Keys West Wilderness Backpacking Board along Park Boulevard and enjoy a hike for as long as you would like.  This trail has little shade and unreliable cell service. Always check the weather forecast before heading into the park and consider changing plans if the weather conditions are too extreme. Before hiking, tell a safety buddy where you are going and when you plan on leaving the park. ",0,Challenging

It is a hiking challenge! It is a ghost story re-told! We are daring you to be like dune advocate Alice Mabel Gray, also known as Diana of the Dunes. She hiked and lived in the dunes on her own in an abandoned shanty for over 9 years in the early 1900s and took an interest in the history, ecology, and preservation of Indiana Dunes.  How to Complete the Dare. 1 - Go to West Beach. West Beach Parking Lot 376 North County Line Road, Gary, IN 46403","What is the Diana Dunes Dare? It is a hiking challenge! It is a ghost story re-told! We are daring you to be like dune advocate Alice Mabel Gray, also known as Diana of the Dunes. She hiked and lived in the dunes on her own in an abandoned shanty for over 9 years in the early 1900s and took an interest in the history, ecology, and preservation of Indiana Dunes.  Alice? Who is Alice? Diana of the Dunes became a legend in her own time. She was born in Chicago as Alice Mabel Gray. She was tagged Diana of the Dunes by area reporters because she chose to live a very different life from most of the women at that time. She was a well educated woman who studied at the University of Chicago and worked for a time at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington DC as a computer programmer. She had a profound change of heart for reasons that are not very clear, but many newspapers at the time created a persona for the woman who chose to live alone in the wilds of the Indiana dunes. Well, won’t spoil the entire plot here, so you will have to get out to West Beach and read the signs to complete the dare. What’s the trail like? Starting from the parking lot, hikers can climb the stairs of the Dune Succession Trail. Count the steps along the way! At the first wayside, you can pause on top of the great staircase and let the breeze surround you as it heightens your senses. At this boundless vantage point you can choose your view. You can gaze 36 miles into the distance to see the towering might of Chicago, the birthplace of our gallant advocate Alice. You can choose to see the abrupt line of contrast of where industry and nature collide. Or you can turn your regard to the delicate, diverse rolling beauty of the dune succession and its fragility.  At the second wayside, you can get nestled on a bench in the dune swale as you contemplate the dynamic and complex landscape. You may hear the immense roar of the waves to the north or notice the quietness of an interdunal pond just at the foot of the jack pines. If you read the landscape, as Diana did, you can understand its message. The jack pines would have told Diana that she is close to the water. Jack pines are pioneer plants which are one of the first to root at the forefront of the shoreline because they do not like to compete with the mighty inland oak forest to the south. Diana listened, understood, and became harmonic with nature in these very dunes.  Along the beach to the bathhouse - Listen to the rhythms of the waves and let yourself sync with nature. Feel the sun on your soul and contemplate the many calls of the gulls and hear the singing sands dance along the shoreline. Let the diverse harmony of the dune landscape sculpt your affirmations. Dare to become a positive force in protecting these ecosystems much like Diana did. Vow your pledge of preservation and protection to the social media world by stopping by the selfie station and hash tagging #dianadunesdare.

View Montezuma Castle,30-45 Minutes,"Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall",Montezuma Castle National Monument,AZ,https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/view-montezuma-castle.htm,"Visitors can view two cliff dwellings while visiting the park, Montezuma Castle and Castle A. An accessible, 0.3 mile trail loops around the site and features many views of both the dwellings and the creekside ecosystem they rise above. Interpretive signs offer insight into the lives of the people that built and thrived in this community.","At Montezuma Castle National Monument, visitors can view two cliff dwellings built by the Hisatsinom, or Sinagua people, around 1150 CE. These impressive feats of engineering are a testament to the people that lived here and the community they were a part of. Although the dwellings seen here were constructed starting around 1150, people lived in this area long before they were built. These structures were occupied until the Hisatsinom left the area by about the early 1400s. Despite their appearance, the dwellings here are not abandoned and forgotten; they are celebrated and remembered. Many indigenous peoples maintain a strong connection with this land and site today.  A 0.3 mile (0.5 km) paved loop trail around the site and offers numerous views of the dwellings as we see them today. Montezuma Castle is located about 100 yards (91 m) from the visitor center. Castle A is located on the far side of the loop, about 160 yards (146 m) from the visitor center. More than 95% of what we see of the main dwelling, Montezuma Castle, is original with some work performed over the years to stabilize the structure. Its location inside the cliff is largely what is responsible for its preservation, keeping it protected from the elements.  A short spur trail allows visitors a closer look at Castle A, a dwelling that was about twice the size of Montezuma Castle. This structure was burned sometime between 1375 and 1395 during a dispute between the Apache, Yavapai, and Hisatsinom, but some of the stonework and caveate rooms are still visible along the cliff.  Due to the sensitivity of these sites, tours inside Montezuma Castle were discontinued in 1951 and access to Castle A was discontinued in 1978. Please respect the dwellings here by remaining on the trail and not sitting on or climbing them. A five minute video tour of the inside of Montezuma Castle plays on loop in the museum during operating hours. Safety  Bring water on your walk. Although the trail is mostly shaded, summer high temperatures range from 95° to 115°F (35° to 46°C). The park does not sell bottled water, but water bottles can be purchased from the bookstore and a water bottle refill station is available at the visitor center. From spring through fall, rattlesnakes are often seen in the park and may be present on the trails. If you encounter a rattlesnake during your visit, please let a staff member know immediately. Park rangers are specially trained to relocate rattlesnakes in a way that is safe for people and the snake. Never attempt to handle or move a snake yourself and give all snakes at least six feet of space. Please remember that we are visitors in their home; rattlesnakes and all other park wildlife are protected from harm or harassment by law.  Regulations  Never climb or sit on the dwellings or structures. Please stay on the trail at all times. Drones and other unmanned aircraft are not permitted in the park. Please leave all plants, animals, rocks, artifacts, bones, and other items where you find them for others to enjoy. If you find something interesting on the trail, take a photo to share with a ranger. Pets are welcome on the trails but must be on a leash no more than six feet at all times.

Since Valles Caldera is a relatively new National Park Service site, trails are not well-marked, and most trailheads do not yet have signs. For this reason, it is imperative for hikers to carry a detailed park map to help identify landmarks and topography.   On many trails in the park, hikers will encounter large areas burned by the Las Conchas Fire (2011) and the Thompson Ridge Fire (2013). Do not linger in areas with standing dead trees, especially if it's windy or snowy. Trails in burned areas are also likely to have heavy deadfall to climb over or around. Please report any trail damage or obstacles to a park ranger.  If you wish to drive to a trailhead beyond the Cabin District, a backcountry vehicle pass is required. The backcountry route is open to vehicular traffic from May 15 to November 15 each year. Valles Caldera National Preserve issues 40 backcountry vehicle passes per day, and they are available to reserve up to 3 months in advance at Recreation.gov.  Know Before you Go  Leashed pets are allowed only on the Cerro La Jara Loop, South Valle Grande Trail, Rabbit Mountain Loop, and Cabin District Trail. Dogs are not permitted in vehicles beyond the Cabin District. The Santa Fe National Forest, which surrounds Valles Caldera National Preserve, offers even more hiking options for those with pets. Even on short day hikes, carry your ""ten essentials"" including maps, compass, and/or GPS, sun protection, clothing layers, illumination with extra batteries, first aid supplies, repair kits and tools, food, water, and emergency shelter. Hunting occurs in the park every spring and fall. Hikers should wear bright colors and use situational awareness during these seasons. Remember, safety is your responsibility. Let a friend or family member know your itinerary.  High Elevation Dangers Much of Valles Caldera is over 8,000 feet in elevation. Even very fit individuals coming from lower elevations may experience altitude problems. Symptoms include headaches, shortness of breath, insomnia, and rapid heartbeat. After a few days, your body will have made some physiological adjustments to higher elevations, but full acclimation may take weeks. To minimize symptoms, drink plenty of fluids, avoid alcohol, don't skip meals, and get plenty of rest. Ultraviolet light is stronger in the mountains because there is less atmosphere for the sunlight to pass through. Wear sunscreen, a hat, sunglasses, and consider wearing a long-sleeved shirt if you are out in the sun for an extended period of time. Hiking Seasons and Conditions Winter: Valles Caldera receives several feet of snow between November and April, and winter temperatures routinely stay below zero. Warm, layered clothing and sun protection are imperative. When snow conditions are suitable, groomed ski and snowshoe trails are available for visitors to enjoy. For visitor safety, pedestrian traffic is not permitted on roadways that are open to vehicles in the winter.   Spring: The months of April and May are extremely muddy at Valles Caldera as snowmelt saturates the ground and floods the valles. Hiking in wet and muddy conditions can cause extensive damage to park trails.  Summer: After the snow melts and drains from the mountains, wildflowers begin to pop across the montane grasslands. Summer mornings are wonderful for hiking, but beware of violent afternoon thunderstorms during monsoon season (generally June–August). It is possible to experience all four seasons in one day, and weather conditions can change rapidly, so be sure to come properly equipped with adequate clothing, including rain gear. Some routes pass through drainages or dry streambeds (arroyos), which can flood without warning.  Fall: Valles Caldera is quite lovely from September through November as the aspen leaves run through their colorful seasonal cycle and the elk enter the rut. Wildlife are particularly active during the fall months, so it's important to practice situational awareness and maintain a safe distance from any animal you encounter. As the seasons change, high winds are common in the valles, so pack a hat, layers, plenty of drinking water, and chapstick! Water Due to the high elevation and dry climate, you must drink more water here than in other places, regardless of season. Always carry adequate water (2-3 liters per person per day). There is no drinking water available at Valles Caldera National Preserve except for the bottled water available for purchase at the Entrance Station and Ranger Station. Water from East Fork, Jaramillo Creek, San Antonio Creek, and any other springs is not safe to drink. Boil or treat water from these sources before using. Navigation The maze of logging and ranching roads of the past create excellent avenues into this beautiful landscape, but navigation can be confusing. Some signage exists, but as a new unit to the National Park Service, Valles Caldera is in the process of developing its trail management and maintenance plan. Improvements to some routes will be made, while others may be decommissioned. For your safety, please take a navigable map and compass or GPS.

The Burma Trail follows part of the trace of the old Burma Road, an off-road vehicle route used before the area's wilderness designation in 1980. Most of the road has disappeared under dunes or vegetation, but in some places it remains clear. Hikers may also find traces of human development, such as concrete pads used by the US Life Saving Service and Coast Guard, bricks used for summer bungalows, or the remnants of shipwrecks along the shore. While these reminders of the human past may seem to run counter to the idea of wilderness, you might think of the area as reclaimed by nature, rather than “untouched” or “pristine.”  The Burma Trail allows access to wilderness for hikers, photographers, birders, campers, anglers, hunters, and others. Whether your visit is for a short stroll, a full-day outing, or an overnight trip, visitors should take care to keep this area wild and minimize their impact on the landscape and wildlife.  Hikers typically access the trail at the Wilderness Visitor Center or Watch Hill. Those interested in hiking during cooler months from the western end can take a ferry and walk an additional mile from Davis Park (ferry service is limited between October and May – check the latest schedule).  Interested in camping overnight? Learn more about backcountry camping in the Otis Pike Wilderness. Hike Smart  Hike the trail in cooler months. Mosquitoes are prevalent north of the primary dune from late spring until late fall. The trail is best enjoyed during cooler seasons when adult mosquitoes are not present. Hiking on the ocean beach can be a more comfortable option in warmer months. Stay on paths. Protect vegetation and dunes by staying on trail or on deer paths. Walking on paths also helps avoid ticks and poison ivy. Trail conditions. Storms can cause flooding and overwashing of sand on the trail. Be prepared to wade flooded areas and navigate through altered sections of trail. Parts of the trail may become overgrown with brush. If the trail is impassable, walk to the ocean side through a low point in the dunes and walk the beach. Backcountry camping in the east or west zones requires a permit purchased on recreation.gov. Campers can select a campsite in established zones north of the primary dune year-round or on the beach between March 15 and Labor Day. Learn more about backcountry camping. Check the weather and tides before your hike. Storms and seasonal tides can present dangerous conditions with ocean water pushing to the dune line and causing overwashes in low-lying areas. This creates river-like washes that can sweep away tents and cause hazardous conditions if wading across.

",Hiking,,Challenging,0,"Download a trail map (PDF - 1.74 MB)  Burma Trail is a seven-mile-long footpath that spans the Otis Pike Fire Island High Dune Wilderness Area from Watch Hill to Smith Point.  The Burma Trail follows part of the trace of the old Burma Road, an off-road vehicle route used before the area's wilderness designation in 1980. Most of the road has disappeared under dunes or vegetation, but in some places it remains clear. Hikers may also find traces of human development, such as concrete pads used by the US Life Saving Service and Coast Guard, bricks used for summer bungalows, or the remnants of shipwrecks along the shore. While these reminders of the human past may seem to run counter to the idea of wilderness, you might think of the area as reclaimed by nature, rather than “untouched” or “pristine.”  The Burma Trail allows access to wilderness for hikers, photographers, birders, campers, anglers, hunters, and others. Whether your visit is for a short stroll, a full-day outing, or an overnight trip, visitors should take care to keep this area wild and minimize their impact on the landscape and wildlife.  Hikers typically access the trail at the Wilderness Visitor Center or Watch Hill. Those interested in hiking during cooler months from the western end can take a ferry and walk an additional mile from Davis Park (ferry service is limited between October and May – check the latest schedule).  Interested in camping overnight? Learn more about backcountry camping in the Otis Pike Wilderness. Hike Smart  Hike the trail in cooler months. Mosquitoes are prevalent north of the primary dune from late spring until late fall. The trail is best enjoyed during cooler seasons when adult mosquitoes are not present. Hiking on the ocean beach can be a more comfortable option in warmer months. Stay on paths. Protect vegetation and dunes by staying on trail or on deer paths. Walking on paths also helps avoid ticks and poison ivy. Trail conditions. Storms can cause flooding and overwashing of sand on the trail. Be prepared to wade flooded areas and navigate through altered sections of trail. Parts of the trail may become overgrown with brush. If the trail is impassable, walk to the ocean side through a low point in the dunes and walk the beach. Backcountry camping in the east or west zones requires a permit purchased on recreation.gov. Campers can select a campsite in established zones north of the primary dune year-round or on the beach between March 15 and Labor Day. Learn more about backcountry camping. Check the weather and tides before your hike. Storms and seasonal tides can present dangerous conditions with ocean water pushing to the dune line and causing overwashes in low-lying areas.

Allow 15 to 20 minutes driving time from Bear Valley to the closest trailheads to Sculptured Beach.,"Distances: From the Limantour Beach parking lot: 5.4 miles (8.6 km) roundtrip, easy From the Laguna Trailhead: 6.6 miles (10.6 km) roundtrip, easy/moderate From the Coast Trailhead: 8.6 miles (13.8 km) roundtrip, easy An easy to moderate walk through coastal scrub and grassland offers some breath-taking ocean views and leads to the rocky shoreline of Sculptured Beach, where one can look for intertidal organisms when the tide is very low. Visit our tidepooling for more information and please follow Leave No Trace's Tips for Tide Pooling. Consult a tide chart and local weather forecasts before setting out on your trip; venturing on to Sculptured Beach during hazardous surf conditions or a high tide can result in becoming trapped against the coastal bluffs. Visit the park's Beach Safety page for more information. Some of this area was burned in 2020, when lightning strikes in the Woodward Valley started what became the 2020 Woodward Fire. There are vault toilets and potable water available at Coast Campground. Sculptured Beach and the Laguna Trail, the Fire Lane Trail, and the Coast Trail southeast of Coast Campground are within the Phillip Burton Wilderness. Please practice Leave No Trace principles. The routes described below pass through or by Coast Campground, where you can refill your water bottle at one of the campgrounds water faucets, or use the vault toilets. Closest Trailheads to Sculptured Beach  Limantour Beach. There are two parking lots at Limantour Beach:  The main parking lot is located on the right as one descends Limantour Road toward the beach. It has a gravel surface and has space for a couple hundred vehicles. A small paved parking lot is located at the end of a spur road that leads east from Limantour Road just before one reaches the main lot. This parking lot only has 16 parking spaces. If you arrive early enough to park in one of these spaces (or are lucky to find a space later in the day), the hike to and from Sculptured Beach will be ~0.8 km (1.3 km) shorter roundtrip.   Laguna Trailhead Coast Trailhead  Directions to Sculptured Beach There are dozens of hiking routes that lead to Sculptured Beach. Even from the three closest trailheads (routes from which are described below), there are six or more different combinations of hiking on trails or walking on the beach that will get one to and from Sculptured Beach. This is due to how the Coast Trail runs parallel to the beach with three locations at which one can descend from the trail to the beach. Please note: Storms in early 2023 caused significant damage to the Sculptured Beach Trail and the route is no longer a trail that the park will recognize or maintain. Please refrain from using it. Beach Access Trails that connect with the Coast Trail  Coast Trail's Limantour Beach Access Trail: This short connector trail is ~0.6 miles (0.9 km) from the small paved lot or ~1 mile (1.6 km) from the main parking lot at Limantour Beach. Or, if hiking from the Coast Trailhead, follow the Coast Trail for 1.9 miles (3 km). Or, if coming from Coast Campground, follow the Coast Trail west for 1.1 miles (1.8 km) or walk west on the beach for 0.8 miles (1.3 km). Look for a lone large pine tree growing on the edge of a low bluff. Just west of the tree is a 100-foot-long (30-meter-long) sandy path leading from the beach to Coast Trail. Coast Campground's Santa Maria Beach Access Trail: The second location to connect between the beach and the Coast Trail is at the Coast Campground. From the Coast Trail, a 600-foot-long (180-meter-long) dirt path branches off of the Coast Trail to the north of site 8, passing to the left of some hitching rails and, further along the path, to the right of a lone eucalyptus tree. This path descend along the east side of a creek that flows down to Santa Maria Beach. From the beach, this path isn't as obvious, especially if one is walking along the water's edge. Pay attention to the height of the bluffs. To the west of this beach access, the bluffs are significantly lower than to the east. The creek can also serve as a landmark. During drier periods, the creek's water may not stay above the surface of the beach all the way to the bay, but during the winter and spring, water from the creek will frequently flow over the sand to the bay, forcing one to get at least the soles of their shoes wet as they cross the creek. Coming from the west, it will be the first significant creek that flows onto the beach east of Limantour Beach's parking lots. Coming from the west, the Santa Maria Beach Access Trail is ~1.4 miles (2.2 km) from Limantour Beach's small parking lot and ~1.8 miles (2.9 km) from the main lot, and 0.8 miles (1.3 km) from the Coast Trail's Limantour Beach Access Trail. Coming from the east (e.g., from Sculptured Beach), it will be the second creek one crosses after leaving Sculptured Beach, which is 0.8 miles (1.3 km) away. Sculptured Beach Trail: Indefinitely closed due to storm damage. The 0.2-mile-long (0.3-km-long) Sculptured Beach Trail descends from the Coast Trail 1.3 miles (2.1 km) southeast of Coast Campground. Or, if one has walked on the beach from the west and wants to ascend to the Coast Trail, look for a wooden stairway leading up from Sculptured Beach 0.8 miles (1.3 km) east of the Santa Maria Beach Access Trail. These stairs are at the north end of a deeper sandy cove just west of some off-white-colored low-profile promontories that stretch out into the bay.-->  Directions from the Limantour Beach parking lots Follow the path from either parking lot at Limantour Beach to the beach and head southeast on the beach for 2.1 miles (3.4 km) if you started from the smaller paved parking lot or 2.4 miles (3.8 km) if you started from the main parking lot. So long as the tide is low enough, you should be able to walk along the water's edge all the way to Sculptured Beach.  From the Coast Trail's Limantour Beach Access Trail, head southeast (to the right toward Coast Campground) on the Coast Trail for 2.4 miles (3.8 km) to the Sculptured Beach Trail junction. From the Coast Campground's Santa Maria Beach Access Trail, turn right on to Coast Trail and follow it 1.3 miles (2.1 km) to the Sculptured Beach Trail junction.  At the Sculptured Beach Trail junction, turn right and follow this path for 0.2 miles (0.3 km) to Sculptured Beach.--> Directions from the Laguna Trailhead This route steadily ascends the 0.8-mile-long (1.3-kilometer-long) southern leg of the Laguna Trail to a 400-foot-high (120-meter-high) ridge crest from which Drakes Bay is visible. The route then descends via the 1-mile-long (1.6-kilometer-long) southern leg of the Fire Lane Trail to the Coast Trail just north of the Coast Campground. Turn left on the Coast Trail for 0.1 miles (160 m) to reach the Coast Campground and it's Santa Maria Beach Access Trail.   -->Descend to the beach and walk along the water's edge for 0.8 miles (1.3 km) to get to Sculptured Beach. (This route is dependent upon the tide being low enough for safe passage along the base of the bluffs.)  Continue southeast on the Coast Trail for a total of 1.3 miles (2.1 km) through and past the Coast Campground and the Woodward Valley Trail junction to the Sculptured Beach Trail junction. Turn right and follow this path for 0.2 miles (0.3 km) to Sculptured Beach.  -->Return along the beach to the Coast Campground, where you can either return to the Laguna Trailhead via the Fire Lane and Laguna trails. Or follow the Coast Trail to the Coast Trailhead, which is located across the Laguna Road from Limantour Lodge. Turn right on to Laguna Road and walk a short distance along the road to return to your vehicle. Directions from the Coast Trailhead Follow the Coast Trail for 2.8 miles (4.5 km) alongside a stream and then through bluff-top coastal grasslands to the Coast Campground. (As described above, one may descend to the beach after hiking 1.9 miles [3.1 km], if one so desires.) Continue southeast on the Coast Trail for another 1.3 miles (2.1 km) through and past the Coast Campground and past the Woodward Valley Trail junction to the Sculptured Beach Trail junction. Turn right and follow this path for 0.2 miles (0.3 km) to Sculptured Beach. -->To return to the Coast Trailhead, retrace your steps. Alternatively, as described above, there are a number of other options, including returning via the Fire Lane and Laguna Trails to make your hike more of a loop hike. To do so, turn right onto the Fire Lane Trail 0.1 mile (0.2 km) west of the Coast Campground and follow the Fire Lane Trail and then the Laguna Trail 1.8 miles (2.9 km) back to the Laguna Trailhead. Walk through the Laguna Trailhead parking area to Laguna Road, turn left, and follow the road back to your vehicle at the Coast Trailhead. The Coast Trail is a family-friendly, multi-use trail on which bicycles are allowed as far as Coast Campground. There is a bike rack bollard to which one may lock their bicycles near the Santa Maria Beach Access Trail junction. Visit the park's Bicycle Riding page for more information.

Or, if one has walked on the beach from the west and wants to ascend to the Coast Trail, look for a wooden stairway leading up from Sculptured Beach 0.8 miles (1.3 km) east of the Santa Maria Beach Access Trail. These stairs are at the north end of a deeper sandy cove just west of some off-white-colored low-profile promontories that stretch out into the bay.-->  Directions from the Limantour Beach parking lots Follow the path from either parking lot at Limantour Beach to the beach and head southeast on the beach for 2.1 miles (3.4 km) if you started from the smaller paved parking lot or 2.4 miles (3.8 km) if you started from the main parking lot. So long as the tide is low enough, you should be able to walk along the water's edge all the way to Sculptured Beach.  From the Coast Trail's Limantour Beach Access Trail, head southeast (to the right toward Coast Campground) on the Coast Trail for 2.4 miles (3.8 km) to the Sculptured Beach Trail junction. From the Coast Campground's Santa Maria Beach Access Trail, turn right on to Coast Trail and follow it 1.3 miles (2.1 km) to the Sculptured Beach Trail junction.  At the Sculptured Beach Trail junction, turn right and follow this path for 0.2 miles (0.3 km) to Sculptured Beach.--> Directions from the Laguna Trailhead This route steadily ascends the 0.8-mile-long (1.3-kilometer-long) southern leg of the Laguna Trail to a 400-foot-high (120-meter-high) ridge crest from which Drakes Bay is visible. The route then descends via the 1-mile-long (1.6-kilometer-long) southern leg of the Fire Lane Trail to the Coast Trail just north of the Coast Campground. Turn left on the Coast Trail for 0.1 miles (160 m) to reach the Coast Campground and it's Santa Maria Beach Access Trail.   -->Descend to the beach and walk along the water's edge for 0.8 miles (1.3 km) to get to Sculptured Beach. (This route is dependent upon the tide being low enough for safe passage along the base of the bluffs.)  Continue southeast on the Coast Trail for a total of 1.3 miles (2.1 km) through and past the Coast Campground and the Woodward Valley Trail junction to the Sculptured Beach Trail junction. Turn right and follow this path for 0.2 miles (0.3 km) to Sculptured Beach.  -->Return along the beach to the Coast Campground, where you can either return to the Laguna Trailhead via the Fire Lane and Laguna trails. Or follow the Coast Trail to the Coast Trailhead, which is located across the Laguna Road from Limantour Lodge. Turn right on to Laguna Road and walk a short distance along the road to return to your vehicle. Directions from the Coast Trailhead Follow the Coast Trail for 2.8 miles (4.5 km) alongside a stream and then through bluff-top coastal grasslands to the Coast Campground. (As described above, one may descend to the beach after hiking 1.9 miles [3.1 km], if one so desires.) Continue southeast on the Coast Trail for another 1.3 miles (2.1 km) through and past the Coast Campground and past the Woodward Valley Trail junction to the Sculptured Beach Trail junction. Turn right and follow this path for 0.2 miles (0.3 km) to Sculptured Beach. -->To return to the Coast Trailhead, retrace your steps. Alternatively, as described above, there are a number of other options, including returning via the Fire Lane and Laguna Trails to make your hike more of a loop hike. To do so, turn right onto the Fire Lane Trail 0.1 mile (0.2 km) west of the Coast Campground and follow the Fire Lane Trail and then the Laguna Trail 1.8 miles (2.9 km) back to the Laguna Trailhead. Walk through the Laguna Trailhead parking area to Laguna Road, turn left, and follow the road back to your vehicle at the Coast Trailhead. The Coast Trail is a family-friendly, multi-use trail on which bicycles are allowed as far as Coast Campground. There is a bike rack bollard to which one may lock their bicycles near the Santa Maria Beach Access Trail junction. Visit the park's Bicycle Riding page for more information. Be Prepared This route description alone is not a substitute for a trail map.

Hike the Woodward Valley Loop,6-7 Hours,"Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall",Point Reyes National Seashore,CA,https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/hike-the-woodward-valley-loop.htm,"Travel from forest to tidepools on this ambitious hike. This trail includes beautiful forest and spectacular coastal hiking with sweeping ocean views, though much of this area was burned in the Woodward Fire that began as lightning strikes in August of 2020. This hike starts at the Bear Valley Trailhead, at the south end of the Bear Valley Parking Lot. Most of this hike's distance is within the Phillip Burton Wilderness.","Distance: ~13 miles (21 km), strenuous  Travel from forest to tidepools on this ambitious walk through the central part of the Phillip Burton Wilderness. This trail includes beautiful forest and spectacular coastal hiking with sweeping ocean views. Much of this area through which this route passes was burned in the Woodward Fire, which was started by lightning strikes in August of 2020. Start at the Bear Valley Trailhead and follow the relatively flat Bear Valley Trail south. A short distance beyond a sign indicating you are entering the Phillip Burton Wilderness, you will get to choose between two routes that will lead you to the Sky Trail along the crest of Inverness Ridge.  Turn right on to the Mount Wittenberg Trail 0.2 miles (0.3 km) from the trailhead if you want a more strenuous ascent of about 1,130 feet (~340 m) over a distance of 1.8 miles (2.9 km). While the Woodward Fire burned along most of the length of the Mount Wittenberg Trail, it primarily burned in the understory and left most of the canopy of the Douglas fir forest intact. As a result, there are very few far-reaching views from this trail until you reach the ridge crest. Remain on the Mount Wittenberg Trail at the Z Ranch Trail junction, which is located at the highest point along this route with an elevation of 1270 feet (385 m).* From the crest of Inverness Ridge along the western 0.4 mile-long (0.6-kilometer-long) leg of the Mount Wittenberg Trail, you may be rewarded (weather dependent) with views looking west across the peninsula to the Pacific Ocean. The Mount Wittenberg Trail intersects with the Sky Trail 0.4 miles (0.6 km) beyond the Z Ranch Trail junction and 2.4 miles (3.8 km) from the Bear Valley Trailhead. *From Mount Wittenberg-Z Ranch Trail junction, the 0.3-mile-long (0.5-kilometer-long) Mount Wittenberg Summit Trail leads, as its name suggests, to the summit of Mount Wittenberg (elevation 1407 feet (426 m). The once unobstructed views from near the summit have, since 2000, become obstructed by dense Douglas fir thickets that sprouted shortly after the 1995 Vision Fire. While the 2020 Woodward Fire burned through much of the forest around Mount Wittenberg, the view-obstructing Douglas fir thickets were largely left unscathed. So, without being rewarded with views for their effort, many hikers pass on ascending the Mount Wittenberg Summit Trail. Turn right on to the Meadow Trail 0.8 miles (1.3 km) from the trailhead if you want a slightly easier climb over Inverness Ridge. Similar to the Mount Wittenberg Trail, the Woodward Fire mostly impacted the understory of the forest along the Meadow Trail. While the trail does pass through a fairly large meadow (after which the trail was named), views from the meadow are of forested hillsides less than a mile distant. The Meadow Trail ascends about 840 feet (~255 m) over a distance of 1.6 miles (2.6 km) before intersecting with the Sky Trail 2.4 miles (3.8 km) from the Bear Valley Trailhead. The elevation at this intersection is ~1080 feet (~327 m).  Both the Mount Wittenberg Trail and the Meadow Trail intersect the Sky Trail at the same large trail junction. Turn left (south) on to the Sky Trail and follow it for 0.8 miles (1.3 km) to its junction with the Woodward Valley Trail. Once hemmed in by a ~six-foot-tall (~two-meter-tall) hedge of huckleberry bushes, the Woodward Fire cleared out most of the shrubs and a lot of the lower branches of the trees in this area so that this section of trail feels a bit more open than it did before 2020. Turn right (west) on to the Woodward Valley Trail, which was one of the lushest, greenest trails in the park before the Woodward Fire. The Woodward Valley Trail descends about 800 feet (~240 meters) over a distance of 2.0 miles (3.2 km) before intersecting with the Coast Trail, where you will turn left/south. Open ocean views are plentiful along the last 0.5 miles (0.8 km) of the Woodward Valley Trail and along the length of the Coast Trail as you pass through coastal grasslands intermixed with some coastal scrub. The Sculptured Beach Trail branches off after 0.5 miles (0.8 km), leading down to Sculptured Beach, where there are tidepools exposed at low tides. A second location to descend to a beach occurs 2.5 miles (4 km) later when you reach the Kelham Beach Trail junction. The Sculptured Beach and Kelham Beach Trails are indefinitely closed due to storm damage.  Continuing south on the Coast Trail for another 0.9 miles (1.5 km ) brings you to the Coast-Bear Valley Trail junction. Turn left on to the Bear Valley Trail and follow it 4 miles (6.4 km) east and north back to the Bear Valley Trailhead parking lot. The Bear Valley Trail has a gentle grade as it first follows Coast Creek to Divide Meadow and then gradually descends along Bear Valley Creek for the final 1.6 miles (2.6 km) of this hike. Aside from the large meadow at Divide Meadow, the trail passes through a beautiful forest of buckeyes, oaks, and Douglas firs. Restrooms and water are available at the Bear Valley Trailhead parking lot. Otherwise, there are no other facilities along this route until you reach Divide Meadow, at which there are vault toilets, but no potable water.

From the Sky-Meadow trail junction, turn north on to the Sky Trail, which, in 0.5 miles (0.8 km) leads past Sky Campground, before returning to the trailhead 1.3 mile (2.1 km) later. Mount Wittenberg took its name from Peter and Newton Wittenberg, who are believed to be the first occupants of the Z Ranch in the early 1860s. The Z Ranch was located at the present-day Sky Campground. The Z Ranch was the highest elevation ranch on the peninsula. All that remains of the ranch operation are eucalyptus and cypress trees that were planted as wind breaks and the remains of a concrete pathway that leads to the old ranch spring.

Stevens Canyon Road is open to vehicles during the summer season only, typically June-September.    Bench Lake is a short hike to a subalpine lake with views of Mount Rainier. It gets its name from the flat area around the lake called “The Bench.” This relatively flat, shelf-like landform on the west side of Stevens Canyon was created by a lava flow that erupted about 91,000 years ago.  Snow Lake is tucked against the rocky Tatoosh Range below Unicorn Peak. Snow Lake may have been named because the cirque in which it lies is filled by icy meltwater from the snowfields of the Tatoosh Range or because snow often rings the lake until late summer.  The trailhead is located one and a half miles east of the Reflection Lakes parking area on the south side of the road. The trail is a succession of ups and downs as it crosses a series of low ridges. The path first reaches Bench Lake after 0.75 mile, then continues another 0.5 mile to Snow Lake. Snow Lake has two backcountry camping sites, a bear pole, and a toilet. A wilderness permit is required for overnight camping.

It gets its name from the flat area around the lake called “The Bench.” This relatively flat, shelf-like landform on the west side of Stevens Canyon was created by a lava flow that erupted about 91,000 years ago.  Snow Lake is tucked against the rocky Tatoosh Range below Unicorn Peak. Snow Lake may have been named because the cirque in which it lies is filled by icy meltwater from the snowfields of the Tatoosh Range or because snow often rings the lake until late summer.  The trailhead is located one and a half miles east of the Reflection Lakes parking area on the south side of the road. The trail is a succession of ups and downs as it crosses a series of low ridges. The path first reaches Bench Lake after 0.75 mile, then continues another 0.5 mile to Snow Lake. Snow Lake has two backcountry camping sites, a bear pole, and a toilet. A wilderness permit is required for overnight camping.

Find the Best Fall Colors in Cuyahoga Valley,,Fall,Cuyahoga Valley National Park,OH,https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/best-fall-colors-cuyahoga-valley.htm,"Leaf peepers, grab your cameras! Here are our tips for where to find Cuyahoga Valley’s best fall colors throughout October.","Leaf peeping fans, here are our tips on where to look for the best fall colors in Cuyahoga Valley. Peak color is usually during the third week of October. The timing is mostly tied to the decrease in daylight hours as winter nears. This makes it fairly consistent year to year. Weather is a factor too. Trees under stress from severe drought or other issues will shed their leaves early. Colors are most vivid when we have warm, sunny days and cool, frost-free nights. Cloudy days and too much rain can dull them. Different broad-leaf trees peak at different times, so it is possible to experience splendid autumn foliage the entire month.  The sugar and red maples are usually the first to display spectacular reds, yellows, and oranges. They are followed by the white and pin oak becoming a brownish red. Black gum, dogwood, and northern red oak turn various shades of red. Tulip tree, bigtooth aspen, silver maple, and black maple change to yellow. Avoid the Crowds We often see a rise in visitation during the fall leaf-peeping season. Many of our parking lots fill up around midday on warm, sunny weekends. Avoid the crowd by coming on weekdays, in the mornings, or later in the day. Early October Walk the inner loop of the Oak Hill Trail. There you can see the magnificent reds of the maple, glowing oranges of the sassafras, and striking yellows of the white ash and big tooth aspen. This trail is especially scenic in the early morning when the large trees in the open fields and by Sylvan Pond become sunlit. Mid October Experience the full autumn spectrum at Brandywine Falls and along the Brandywine Gorge Trail. Colors range from the brilliant reds of the sugar maples to the deep browns of the white oaks. This area is ideal for photography in the late afternoon. Late October Head to the Ledges area trails in Virginia Kendall. These are great places to experience the late turning oaks. Also look for the yellows of hazelnut and witch hazel. Both trees peak late because they grow low in the dense forest. Ledges Overlook offers a view of the changing colors across the Cuyahoga Valley.  Other popular places to view and photograph fall colors are Everett Covered Bridge, Hale Farm & Village, Horseshoe Pond, Kendall Lake, Kendall Hills, and Blue Hen Falls.",Hiking,,Challenging,0,"Leaf peeping fans, here are our tips on where to look for the best fall colors in Cuyahoga Valley.

Hike to Burroughs Mountain,3-6 Hours,Summer,Mount Rainier National Park,WA,https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/hike-to-burroughs-mountain.htm,Hike the Burroughs Mountain Trail for outstanding mountain views and to visit the most accessible tundra in the Cascade Range.,"Season: Summer (July–September) Hike the Burroughs Mountain Trail for outstanding mountain views and to visit the most accessible tundra in the Cascade Range. This series of three peaks on Mount Rainier's northeast slope honors naturalist and essayist John Burroughs. It is a rocky, rounded lava flow formation formed 500-420 thousand years ago during a very active eruptive period. Mats of mountain heather can be hundreds of years old. Look for dwarf versions of plants, like dwarf lupine. While it may look like bare soil between patches of plants, the alpine tundra is fragile so please stay on trail. The Burroughs Mountains can be reached from the Sourdough Ridge or the Sunrise Rim trails. A loop can be made from First Burroughs Mountain that combines both trails. Taking the Sunrise Rim Trail on ascent or descent is only 0.4 miles longer than the Sourdough Ridge Trail. The Sunrise Rim trailhead is located on the south side of the Sunrise parking area. Traveling in a clockwise direction, the trail passes Shadow Lake at 1.2 miles on a level grade then climbs sharply to an overlook on the White River and Emmons Glacier at 1.6 miles. Beyond the overlook the route continues 0.9 miles up and onto the wide, flat plateau of First Burroughs Mountain.

Climb Moro Rock,30-120 Minutes,"Spring, Summer, Fall",Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks,CA,https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/climb-moro-rock.htm,"A stone and concrete stairway leads to the top of Moro Rock, a granite dome that towers over the Generals Highway. From the top, enjoy sweeping views of the hills below and the wilderness to the east.","As you enter Sequoia National Park, Moro Rock looms overhead, thousands of feet above the highway. This massive granite dome juts out from a ridgeline at the edge of the Giant Forest, offering great views.  To get the full experience, take the 350-step staircase all the way to the top. As you ascend, the Great Western Divide of the Sierra Nevada peaks become visible. As you climb, panoramic views open up from the foothills and San Joaquin Valley to the west, to deep into wilderness to the east. If you dare, look over the railing to see the Kaweah River and the Generals Highway, thousands of feet below you. The spectacular, 360-degree view is well worth the strenuous staircase climb to the top.  Handrails along the way make the climb relatively safe, though you should keep a close eye on small children because of steep dropoffs along the entire route.   Moro Rock is located on the Moro Rock / Crescent Meadow Road, 1 mile (1.6 km) from its entrance at the Giant Forest Museum. In summer, free shuttles run from Giant Forest Museum to the Moro Rock parking area. On weekends, the road closes to private vehicles and shuttles are the only way to reach Moro Rock and Crescent Meadow. On weekdays, the road remains open, but the small parking area may be full.

Hike the International Appalachian Trail,2-3 Days,"Spring, Summer, Fall",Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument,ME,https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/hike-the-iat.htm,Hike a segment of the International Appalachian Trail that connects the southern section to the northern section of the monument.,"TheInternational Appalachian Trail (IAT) covers approximately 28.9 miles of trail within Katahdin Woods and Waters NM. The IAT follows old logging roads, crosses Wassataquoik Stream, and meanders through dense boreal forest. The IAT is overgrown in various sections with tall grasses, shrubs, and trees. It is recommended to carry a waterproof map with you, especially if you plan to through hike the entire length of the trail. Signage may be difficult to find in some areas and cell reception is very unreliable. There is no potable water-you will need to pack enough water or purify your own water before drinking. Late spring and summer months typically have high concentrations of biting and stinging insects.  Trail Details The IAT starts at either the North Gate or at Barnard Mountain Trailhead, located in the southern section. Choose your own adventure by starting at either end; hike a little, or hike the whole thing, it is up to you. The following trail details start at the Barnard Mountain Trailhead parking area. Reverse the steps if you are starting from the north section of the monument.  Park at Barnard Mountain Trailhead, a small dirt and gravel parking area located on the Katahdin Loop Road (GPS coordinate: 45.91512, -68.76034). There are no facilities here. The closest vault toilets are at Katahdin Loop Road Overlook or Deasey Pond Trails. Hike north on the IAT following an old logging road for approximately 1 mile and veer right to continue on the IAT. Although the road appears to continue north, follow the sign and veer right to stay on the IAT. From that point, continue to hike north/north-east for approximately 2.5 miles until you reach an intersection. Turn right and hike approximately 1 mile east to access the Wassataquoik Ford.  The Wassataquoik Ford is a river crossing. Safely cross the Wassataquoik Stream to continue on the IAT, or this can also be a good time to turn around. Review the information on stream crossings before visiting. After crossing, look for the small rectangular white and blue IAT sign to continue north. From the Wassataquoik Ford, you will travel approximately 24.5 more miles before reaching the North Gate. As you hike, continue to look for the small rectangular white and blue IAT signs (usually found attached to trees). Areas may become very dense with vegetation in this section of the trail with rocky, slippery, muddy, and uneven surfaces. Enjoy the scenic vistas on top of Deasey Mountain and Lunksoos Mountain as you hike towards the North Gate.  Lunksoos Lean-to is approximately 0.5 miles from Lunksoos Mountain. This is a recommended camping spot when through hiking the IAT. Reserve online and enjoy the beauty of the night sky in an International Dark Sky Sanctuary. From Lunksoos Lean-to it is important to pay close attention to the trail and map due to areas with old logging roads and dense brush. Continue to follow the small rectangular white and blue signs to make sure you are on the IAT. Once you get to the intersection of the IAT and Telos Tote Trail, turn left to stay on the IAT. Hike north along the East Branch of the Penobscot River to the North Gate. There are some smaller stream crossings ahead and areas of deep mud. You will reach a suspension bridge, after approximately 3.4 miles from the IAT/Telos Tote Trail intersection. Continue north to stay on the IAT. (Note: private property across the bridge.) From this point on, continue to hike north on the IAT. You will pass Haskell Gate and continue onto New River Road. Proceed with caution, since New River Road is a gravel road shared with motor vehicles. The monument segment of the IAT ends at the North Gate parking area where you can find a vault toilet.

Traction Devices For much of the winter the most popular trails are so icy that steep sections cannot be safely traversed without some sort of additional traction device for your hiking shoes or boots. Mountaineering crampons or other, lighter options which fasten over your winter footwear work well.

Summer visitors will now have a safer and much less crowded experience at Fern Canyon.  Note: Hikers can still access Fern Canyon by doing the 10-mile round-trip hike on the James Irvine Trail from the Prairie Creek Visitor Center without a reservation.  Prepare to get your feet wet when exploring this short hike into a stunning mini-canyon covered with ferns. This is a very popular walk up a cobbled creek, Home Creek, located east of Gold Bluffs Beach, walking through the creek and climbing over fallen trees is necessary to walk up the canyon. Many travel writers and bloggers are correct when they talk about the natural beauty of this area while you won't find huge redwoods right here it is surrounded by sitka spruce and other conifers.  The trail can be done as a 1-mile ""lolly-pop"" loop with an elevation gain of 150 feet, or hikers can stick to the bed of Home Creek and within quarter of a mile see the steep, leafy walls of Fern Canyon. This in-and-out option has a 30-foot elevation change. Either of these options mean climbing through log jams that have formed due to trees falling into the canyon.  Normally from June to September there are wooden footbridges installed in Fern Canyon to help walkers get partway up Home Creek without getting their feet too wet. Our advice is to wear waterproof footwear with good traction, and bring a pair of dry shoes to wear after the hike.  Be aware that the winding Davison Road (a gravel road) is not suitable for large recreational vehicles or anything towing a trailer. Also, people driving low-clearance vehicles often get stuck when trying to drive through the two streams on the way to the Fern Canyon parking area.  There is a California State Park entrance station on the way out Davison Road where you need to stop and pay the $12.00 entrance fee (per vehicle). Cash or check only for payment, credit cards are not accepted. California State Parks or the America the Beautiful (federal) passes are honored at this kiosk.   A herd of Roosevelt Elk are often spotted around the Fern Canyon area. It is important to keep your distance - don't approach them for any reason. Calving season is from late May to early June, which is when the female (cow) elk are very protective of their babies. Female elk might not have big antlers but they will kick and stomp anyone who gets too close. August through October is the rut season which means the male (bull) elk are especially irritable.

Though we are an urban park, Fort Vancouver can be home to migrating birds, rabbits, and other wildlife. Pets can harass or harm wildlife by making noise or scaring wildlife away. Please keep your dog at a respectful distance from any animals you may encounter.   Know where you can go. Pets are not allowed inside park facilities, including the reconstructed Fort Vancouver, the Visitor Center, and Pearson Air Museum. However, the national park is home to many great, paved trails that dogs (and their humans) love! Learn more about pet-friendly trails at Fort Vancouver here. Pets on leashes are also welcome on the Great Meadow, which is a wonderful spot for a picnic or a family gathering!   Additionally, pets should not be left unattended. Summer heat poses a threat to pets left in vehicles.  Certified guide animals are an exception to these rules and may accompany their owner to all park locations.",0,Challenging

Day Hike Preparation,,"Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall",Guadalupe Mountains National Park,TX,https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/gumo_dayhikeprep.htm,"As with most activities, hikers face potential risks. Knowledge and preparation can increase your comfort level and reduce your chances of injury. Remember, you are ultimately responsible for your own safety.","As with most activities, hikers face potential risks. Knowledge and preparation can increase your comfort level and reduce your chances of injury. Remember, you are ultimately responsible for your own safety. When you arrive, be sure to pick up the park brochure, that includes a map of the backcountry, and a brochure with trail descriptions. Both brochures are available at the Headquarters Visitor Center. In addition to these essential guides, it is recommended that you carry a topographical map and a compass, and know how to use them. Some trails, especially those in the northwest corner of the park, are poorly-defined and can be difficult to follow. Give yourself enough time to reach your destination well before dark, and always have a flashlight and other light source in case of emergency. First Aid Carry a first aid kit with basic essentials and consider extras like tweezers for spines, moleskin for blisters, and a triangular bandage which can be put to many uses. Many park rangers are trained as Emergency Medical Technicians and can offer advice and first aid. You can seek their assistance at the Headquarters Visitor Center, or during an emergency by calling 911. Food Storage When hiking or backpacking, always pick up your litter and food scraps after eating or cooking. When camping, keep a clean camp; properly store food in your vehicle, or hang your food in the backcountry. Guadalupe Mountains National Park does have black bears, mule deer, skunks and other animals that may be interested in your goodies! Summer Hiking The park is located in the northern range of the Chihuahuan Desert and is subjected to hot or dry weather conditions throughout much of the year. When hiking, take frequent breaks and drink plenty of water. The danger from sun exposure cannot be overemphasized! Protect yourself by wearing a hat, sunglasses, and protective clothing, and use sunscreen. Long sleeves and pants protect against sun and sharp desert spines. Watch for rattlesnakes and other poisonous desert dwellers that are common in most areas of the park. During the summer months, afternoon and evening thunderstorms are quite frequent. Remember high ridges are especially susceptible to lightning. Winter Hiking Many visitors are surprised at the severity of the winter weather conditions in Guadalupe Mountains National Park. Fronts bring extreme changes that include strong winds, freezing rain, sleet, heavy snow, and thunderstorms. Prepare for the weather by carrying or wearing protective clothing for wet weather, having several layers of clothing, and wearing a hat and mittens or gloves. Make sure your hiking boots are waterproof. The high elevations frequently receive greater accumulations of snow that can make trails difficult to follow and campsites hard to locate. Please make it your responsibility to turn back if necessary, rather than camp in unauthorized areas, and don't put your safety in jeopardy by continuing in extreme weather conditions. Heat Exposure The body balances heat loss against heat gain to keep the core body temperature within narrow limits. With strenuous exercise in hot climates, heat gain can exceed loss. Core temperatures may rise, sometimes to dangerous levels. Dehydration exacerbates heat illness. Drink plenty of water when exercising in hot weather, before feeling thirsty and after feeling satisfied. Drink enough to produce clear urine regularly during the day. Eat high carbohydrate foods for energy. Avoid heavy exercise in high temperatures and high humidity. Wear light-colored clothes that fit loosely and cover all sun-­exposed skin surfaces. Avoid alcohol and caffeine; both increase loss of fluid.  Heat Exhaustion develops over hours due to water and electrolyte loss from sweating; it causes collapse or gradual exhaustion with an inability to continue to exercise. Symptoms include headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, rapid pulse, thirst and profuse sweating, gooseflesh, chills, and pale skin, and low blood pressure – the victim may faint. Heatstroke occurs in people who undertake heavy exertion in hot climates, and results in sudden collapse with extreme elevation of body temperature, decreased mental status, and shock. It is a medical emergency that can kill; begin treatment immediately. Symptoms include headache, drowsiness, irritability, unsteadiness, confusion, convulsions, coma, a rapid pulse and low blood pressure, and either dry or sweat-moistened hot skin.  What to Bring With You  4 quarts of water per person Good, comfortable, broken-in hiking boots (or at least sturdy shoes with ankle support and good traction) Light jacket/rain jacket (even in summer) Lunch/snacks (bring plenty of food – it is a physically demanding hike that will require plenty of energy) Plastic bag for trash (be sure to pack out all litter) Sunscreen Hat (for sun protection) Lots of warm, layered clothing/hat/gloves (for cooler months) First aid kit/band aids/mole skin for blisters (at least one per group) Trekking poles Headlamp or flashlight if you are planning dawn or dusk hiking.

They are recommended for people who have mobility disabilities, are visiting with children, or have limited time.","The Towpath Trail is beloved in Northeast Ohio. People use it for walking, running, biking, wildlife watching, cross-country skiing, and—in a few spots—horseback riding. It is about 100 miles long, with about 20 miles of those in the national park. Here we are recommending several short walks for those who have mobility disabilities, are visiting with children, or have limited time. These highlights include Ira Trailhead to Beaver Marsh, Station Road Bridge to Mudcatcher, and Canal Exploration Center to Tinkers Creek Aqueduct. The Towpath Trail offers you the opportunity to hike at your own pace and distance. You can visit these locations all in one day or spread the walks out over multiple visits. You’ll find more detailed information, including a list of amenities, at the links to each trailhead. Canal Exploration Center to Tinkers Creek Aqueduct Stroll through history in the northern part of Cuyahoga Valley. Begin at Canal Exploration Center, open seasonally. The trailhead has an information kiosk with park maps, picnic tables, and restrooms. Follow the walkway to the historic white building beside the reconstructed Lock 38. Outdoor exhibits explain how a canal lock worked and the businesses that served waiting boat passengers. Take a photo with Blossom (the bronze mule) and continue south on the Towpath Trail. Tinkers Creek Aqueduct is a natural place to turn around. There are benches along the way. The roundtrip is 1 mile. Extend the walk to 3 miles by turning around at Wilson/Alexander Mill, with Frazee House just beyond there. Station Road Bridge to Mudcatcher This walk combines scenic views of the Cuyahoga River with transportation history and opportunities to see wildlife. Begin at the information kiosk at Station Road Bridge Trailhead. There are restrooms, benches, and drinking water at the nearby Brecksville Station. A cluster of exhibits celebrates the recovery of the Cuyahoga River. These include a tactile eagle and fish as well as an audio station and a heron statue. The view from Station Road Bridge is a favorite with photographers. Continue along the connector to the Towpath Trail and turn left. Take the first left to see where two dams were removed in 2020. Continue north until the path rejoins the main trail. Just beyond the Lock 36 panel is the Mudcatcher panel. During the nesting season, continue a little farther to see the valley’s first eagle nest. At the start of the open field, look left to spy a huge bundle of sticks high in a tree across the river. Turn around here and return along the Towpath to the trailhead. This loop is about 1.5 miles. Boston Store Trailhead to Lock 32 This short walk explores Boston’s history as a canal town. The Boston Store Trailhead offers handicap and limited mobility parking. (Other visitors need to park at Boston Trailhead.) Both lots have bulletin boards with information and park maps. There is drinking water at the restrooms behind the historic store. Shopping and refreshments are inside. Seating is available on the wraparound porch. The Towpath Trail runs beside the building. Cross the road to explore exhibits about canal boat building, including a small play boat for children. Walk north until you reach Lock 32 and its tactile panel. At the far end, look for wildlife in the wetlands which have formed in the old canal. Double back for a roundtrip of 0.2 miles. This walk can be combined with a stop at nearby Boston Mill Visitor Center, open daily. Lock 29 to Peninsula Feeder Start at the Lock 29 Trailhead parking lot. Accessible restrooms are on the east end by the railroad tracks. An information kiosk is on the west end with the historic canal lock just beyond. Walk inside to explore the tactile exhibits. The Towpath Trail crosses over Lock 29 and the Cuyahoga River. Note that the ramp to the upper level has a steeper (but wheelchair accessible) grade. Be alert for bike traffic.

From the Muddy Hollow Trailhead, this loop offers a similar experience and views regardless of whether one follows it clockwise or counter-clockwise. However, just west of the trailhead, the Muddy Hollow Road Trail intersects with Muddy Hollow Creek. No bridge exists at this crossing, so hikers may get their feet wet while attempting to cross this ~8-foot-wide (2.4-meter-wide) creek, especially when the water level is high in the winter and spring. You may want to check out this crossing before starting your hike to determine which direction you will go. If you attempt to cross the creek at the start of the hike and you do get your feet wet, you may not enjoy the hike as much as you hike for the next 7.4 miles (12 km) with wet footwear. If you decide to cross the creek at the end of your hike, you won't have too much further to walk before you can change out of your wet footwear at your vehicle. If you choose to hike the route clockwise, head south on the Muddy Hollow Trail for 0.3 miles (0.5 km) through a riparian (e.g., streamside) zone to the junction with Estero Trail. The Estero Trail heads west out of the valley floor through some coastal scrub and young Bishop pine woodlands up and over a 370-foot-high (112-meter-high) ridge before descending into another valley and crossing the Glenbrook Creek after 2.2 miles (3.5 km). There may be standing water on the trail in the Glenbrook Creek area during winter and spring. Just beyond the Glenbrook Creek is the site of the New Albion Ranch, which is significant as the first dairy on Point Reyes, perhaps in Marin County. All that remains of the ranch, however, are eucalyptus trees that were planted to protect the ranch from the wind. Continue south 0.4 miles (0.6 km) toward the estero (which is Spanish for estuary) and Drakes Bay before making a sharp bend to the north. The trail runs fairly straight along a low ridge crest before intersecting with the Glenbrook Trail in 1.1 miles (1.7 km). The forested ridge in the distance to the north is the northern end of Inverness Ridge, which reaches heights of 1282 feet (388 meters) at Mount Vision and 1336 feet (405 meters) at Point Reyes Hill. The route described on this page will ultimately follow along the western base of this ridge, but won't ascend to its crest. At the Glenbrook Trail junction, you could turn left to stay on the Estero Trail and return via the White Gate and Muddy Hollow Road trails—doing so would add an extra 2 miles (3 km) to your hike. Or continue straight along the ridge crest as the Glenbrook Trail leads 0.6 miles (1 km) north to the Muddy Hollow Road Trail. Turn right and follow the Muddy Hollow Road Trail as it meanders 2.3 miles (3.7 km) along the base of Inverness Ridge back to the trailhead. The Bucklin and Bayview Trails connect with the Muddy Hollow Road Trail and offer routes to ascend to the crest of Inverness Ridge, which would add another ~4 to ~6 miles (6.4 to 9.6 km) to your hike. This route description alone is not a substitute for a trail map. Print out the park's North District trail map (3,409 KB PDF) before your visit, or pick one up at a visitor center on your way.

Find Spring Wildflowers in Cuyahoga Valley,,Spring,Cuyahoga Valley National Park,OH,https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/spring-wildflowers-cuyahoga-valley.htm,Searching for wildflowers is a great way to connect with nature and stay active in spring. Discover what’s blooming along park trails.,"Native spring wildflowers are often called “spring ephemerals” because they appear for such a short time. They must grow and reproduce while temperatures are warm and sunlight can reach the forest floor.  The first to arrive is the skunk cabbage which prefers soggy areas fed by groundwater. Starting in mid-February, look for them near the Ira Trailhead at Beaver Marsh and along the Haskell Run Trail near the Ledges. Their fleshy flowers produce enough heat for them to survive the last of winter.  The next early wildflowers may begin appearing at the end of March, once snow is no longer on the ground. By mid-April, a variety are up and attracting insects for pollination. The blooming frenzy continues through mid-May, until the trees leaf out and cast too much shade. The exact timing of nature’s show varies year-to-year with Northeast Ohio’s notoriously unpredictable weather. It is also impacted by climate change. Once things start, the sequence of wildflowers is fairly predictable.  Coltsfoot (a nonnative which resembles a dandelion), harbinger-of-spring, and spring beauty are often the first bloomers. They are joined shortly by cut-leaved toothwort and bloodroot. Soon large-flowered trillium overshadows them, and squirrel corn and Dutchman’s breeches arrive. Jack-in-the-pulpit begins hiding in his flower, while wild geranium nods nearby. The season’s showstopper is Virginia bluebells which forms a blue carpet along certain streams.  The Stanford Trail blooms early, starting with daffodils which are lovely but nonnative. Bloodroot, trillium, and toothwort pop up a bit later. Look for them closer to the Brandywine Gorge Loop.  The Brandywine Gorge Loop is lovely year-round, but spring showcases a variety of flowers. You may find Dutchman’s breeches, various types of trillium, and mayapples. In mid-spring, we also recommend the 0.8-mile Daffodil Trail in Furnace Run Metro Park and the 1.9-mile Spring Hollow Trail in Hampton Hills Metro Park.  Starting in late April, people flock to the Furnace Run Trail near Everett Covered Bridge to see the Virginia bluebells. Another popular spot is the Hemlock Creek Picnic Area at Bedford Reservation.  To get away from the late-season crowds, consider the Plateau Trail at Oak Hill Trailhead. In May, Jack-in-the-pulpit and wild geranium dot the woodlands.  Here are our ranger tips for wildflower viewing:  Some flowers do not open or open fully on rainy or overcast days. Pick a sunny day to look for wildflowers. Early morning and late afternoon are the best times for wildflower photography. The less wind the better. Stay on the trail. Keep pets on a six-foot leash and on the trail. Above all, do not pick or trample the flowers. Some take years to bloom.

Guadalupe Peak is a rewarding, although very strenuous, 8.4 mile round trip hike with a 3,000 foot elevation gain. It will take from six to eight hours to complete the hike.  The peak provides fantastic views from the highest point in the state of Texas (8,751 feet / 2,667 meters). It also introduces hikers to several of the park’s ecosystems including the high desert and the high elevation forests. On a clear day you will be rewarded with a tremendous view of the surrounding mountains and desert. Stop for a while and enjoy the view before beginning the hike back down. Be Prepared:  Make sure you are prepared for the hike with the Eleven Essential items. Carrying the Ten Essentials (plus one) with you can help you be prepared for minor injuries, sudden weather changes, or unexpected delays. This is a strenuous hike which begins at a mile above sea level and gains 3,000 feet. Do you have a medical conditions that could be worsened by certain activities or changes in altitude (asthma, heart condition)? While the stock trail adds a mile to the hike each direction, it is significantly less steep than the main trail, and may be useful if backpacking.  When you consume half of the water you are carrying, turn around.  The descent is often more difficult than the climb to the peak due to the rocky trail surface and fatigue. Hiking poles help! The top of Texas is not a toilet. Make sure to bring a commercial toilet bag system with you to protect the environment you are hiking in. Pack out all of your trash.  Layers and sunscreen are important to protect you from the elements. At the top of the peak expect temperatures at least ten degrees cooler and wind speeds at least ten miles per hour faster than Pine Springs.  In areas more than a quarter of a mile from restroom facilities, and all areas inside the Wilderness boundary, all solid human waste, feminine hygiene products, and toilet paper must be carried out in a landfill-safe commercial toilet bag. Much of the trail is over steep, rocky terrain. Hikers should wear comfortable hiking boots with good traction, and that are well broken in. Trekking poles aid in stability and can be a useful addition. Hikers should carefully monitor the weather. Afternoon thunderstorms are common through the summer months. Lightning can be especially dangerous at high elevations on the exposed peak. Watch the sky. If storms develop, seek a lower elevation. Winds can be severe on the peak, especially in winter months. Winds in excess of 40 miles per hour are not uncommon. When hiking during high winds, you should always be prepared to turn around. You should prioritize your own safety above all else in windy conditions. There is little shade along the trail. Summer temperatures can be quite hot. Bring plenty of water, at least one gallon per person, per day. Also come prepared with sunscreen, a hat, and protective clothing. The 8.4 mile hike to the summit and back takes the average hiker from six to eight hours round trip. Plan to start the hike early in the morning, especially in the summer when high temperatures and afternoon thunderstorms are a concern. Bring enough warm clothing.

Explore Carbon River in the Winter,0-12 Hours,Winter,Mount Rainier National Park,WA,https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/explore-carbon-river-in-the-winter.htm,"Discover Carbon River, in the beautiful northwest corner of Mount Rainier National Park, where you can hike, bike, or snowshoe during the winter.","Discover Carbon River, in the beautiful northwest corner of Mount Rainier National Park, where you can hike, bike, or snowshoe- or all three!- during the winter. This area of the park provides a unique opportunity to walk or bike along a road that is no longer open to public vehicles. Enjoy the easy grade of the Carbon River Trail (former road) and find yourself in a beautiful setting of old-growth trees, galciers, and the Carbon River.  The Carbon River area is a remote section of the park, only accessible via the Carbon River Road off of SR165. The road is closed at the park entrance, and open to only foot traffic and bicycles beyond that point. NOTE: Be prepared to navigate around road and trail washouts and expect to encounter hazards such as downed trees, snow, and changing weather conditions.  Because of its relatively low elevation of 1,900 feet, the Carbon River area, while remote, is one of the few areas of the park that remains open year-round. During the colder months, the Carbon River Rainforest Nature Trail is often accessible. This 0.3-mile roundtrip hike is perfect for families and avid hikers alike. The boardwalk trail has two branches with interpretive signs exploring the unique temperate rain forest of the area (the bridge connecting the two branches on the far side of the trail is washed out). The boardwalk can be wet and slippery or icy. The Carbon River rain forest is the only true inland rain forest within the park. Walk along the boardwalk and marvel at the old-growth trees and see what kind of life you can find on the forest floor!   There are many other hikes to explore in the area. If you want a multi-sport kind of adventure, consider starting your journey by bicycle. The Carbon River Road Trail once allowed vehicle traffic but has been closed after numerous major washouts and storms. This means visitors can ride their bikes all the way to Ipsut Creek Camp (10 miles round-trip). Exploring by bicycle allows visitors to shave time off their trips and makes many hikes in the area more easily accessible.   The Old Mine Trail, is 2.9 miles round-trip and begins at the Carbon River Entrance. Follow the Carbon River Trail through temperate rain forest, then take a short spur trail to climb up to the entrance of an old mine, transporting hikers to a time often forgotten.. During the winter, the trail may be snow-covered and fallen trees are common obstacles.   For those wanting to view more natural features, Green Lake Trail is an excellent option. From the Carbon River Entrance, hike or bicycle the Carbon River Trail 3.6 miles to the Green Lake Trailhead, then snowshoe the trail 1.8 miles as it climbs through dense forest to a beautiful mountain lake (10.8 miles round-trip). This journey takes visitors to a beautiful cascading waterfall called Ranger Falls before continuing to Green Lake.   Always be prepared for changing weather conditions. The Carbon River area is remote with no cell reception. Ensure that you carry with you the Ten Essentials and always leave your itinerary with a trusted friend or family member who knows when to expect your return. If traveling by bicycle, know how to change a flat and always carry a map. River crossings on the Carbon River are prone to wash outs in fall, winter, and spring. Be prepared to turn back if you encounter washouts. Bikes are only allowed on the Carbon River Road and are not allowed on any trails. Each trailhead has bike racks. Stop in at the Carbon River Ranger Station for maps and current conditions.",Hiking,360.0,Challenging,1,"Discover Carbon River, in the beautiful northwest corner of Mount Rainier National Park, where you can hike, bike, or snowshoe- or all three!- during the winter. This area of the park provides a unique opportunity to walk or bike along a road that is no longer open to public vehicles. Enjoy the easy grade of the Carbon River Trail (former road) and find yourself in a beautiful setting of old-growth trees, galciers, and the Carbon River.  The Carbon River area is a remote section of the park, only accessible via the Carbon River Road off of SR165. The road is closed at the park entrance, and open to only foot traffic and bicycles beyond that point. NOTE: Be prepared to navigate around road and trail washouts and expect to encounter hazards such as downed trees, snow, and changing weather conditions.  Because of its relatively low elevation of 1,900 feet, the Carbon River area, while remote, is one of the few areas of the park that remains open year-round. During the colder months, the Carbon River Rainforest Nature Trail is often accessible. This 0.3-mile roundtrip hike is perfect for families and avid hikers alike. The boardwalk trail has two branches with interpretive signs exploring the unique temperate rain forest of the area (the bridge connecting the two branches on the far side of the trail is washed out). The boardwalk can be wet and slippery or icy. The Carbon River rain forest is the only true inland rain forest within the park. Walk along the boardwalk and marvel at the old-growth trees and see what kind of life you can find on the forest floor!   There are many other hikes to explore in the area. If you want a multi-sport kind of adventure, consider starting your journey by bicycle. The Carbon River Road Trail once allowed vehicle traffic but has been closed after numerous major washouts and storms. This means visitors can ride their bikes all the way to Ipsut Creek Camp (10 miles round-trip). Exploring by bicycle allows visitors to shave time off their trips and makes many hikes in the area more easily accessible.   The Old Mine Trail, is 2.9 miles round-trip and begins at the Carbon River Entrance. Follow the Carbon River Trail through temperate rain forest, then take a short spur trail to climb up to the entrance of an old mine, transporting hikers to a time often forgotten.. During the winter, the trail may be snow-covered and fallen trees are common obstacles.   For those wanting to view more natural features, Green Lake Trail is an excellent option. From the Carbon River Entrance, hike or bicycle the Carbon River Trail 3.6 miles to the Green Lake Trailhead, then snowshoe the trail 1.8 miles as it climbs through dense forest to a beautiful mountain lake (10.8 miles round-trip). This journey takes visitors to a beautiful cascading waterfall called Ranger Falls before continuing to Green Lake.   Always be prepared for changing weather conditions. The Carbon River area is remote with no cell reception.

The walls of the Canyon rise 1500 feet from the banks of the Rio Grande, making this one of the most dramatic and popular places to view the river. The sheer face of this canyon was formed by the Terlingua Fault, which is mostly covered in gravel. Calcite crystals filled in cracks formed by this fault and can be seen along the trail. The deepest channel of the Rio Grande is the international boundary, with each half of this canyon protected by a national park. The southern side belongs to the Area Protegida del Cañón de Santa Elena (Mexico) and the northern side is within Big Bend National Park (USA). Be prepared for mud. During wet times, abrupt rises to Terlingua Creek can make this trail impassable. Always watch for distant rainfall that could lead to flash flooding to avoid becoming stranded within the canyon.  Trail Safety:  Bring Plenty of water; a minimum of 1-2 liters per person  Wear protective clothing, like sun hats and long sleeves  Be aware of wildlife, such as snakes and mountain lions; maintain a safe distance  Watch for water level rises.

Ohanapecosh Area Activities,2-8 Hours,"Summer, Fall",Mount Rainier National Park,WA,https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/ohanapecosh-area-activities.htm,Enjoy all that the Ohanapecosh area has to offer with these four activities.,"The Ohanapecosh area is a beautiful landscape of old-growth trees, wildlife, and the clear blue waters of the Ohanapecosh River. Places for quiet reflection and recreational opportunities abound. If you find yourself in the Ohanapecosh area with some time to spend in nature, consider taking advantage of the endless recreational opportunities.  Hot Springs Trail Perhaps the most family friendly of the list is the 0.4 mile long Hot Springs Trail. This short loop trail is perfect for those who would like to stretch their legs but want to stay close to their campsite or vehicle. Walk beneath massive old-growth trees and meander through the remnants of an early hot springs resort. Stay on trail and do not enter the hot springs.  Fly Fish the Ohanapecosh There are few things better than casting a line into a clear mountain river on a warm summer morning. Open to fly fishing from the first Saturday in June until October 31, the Ohanapecosh River is home to rainbow, brook, and cutthroat trout. This river isn’t considered a fishing destination to most, but experienced anglers enjoy the relaxing blue waters and surrounding old-growth trees.  Silver Falls to the Grove of the Patriarchs Silver Falls and the Grove of the Patriarchs are two of the most popular hikes in the area, but many people chose to hike them separately. Combine the two by beginning your hike at the Ohanapecosh Campground. Hike until you reach Silver Falls and continue on the Eastside Trail for 0.5 mile until you reach the Grove of the Patriarchs Trailhead. Hike through the magnificent old-growth trees before returning the way you came.  Ohanapecosh to Chinook Pass Not for the faint of heart, this 13.3 mile hike from Ohanapecosh to Chinook Pass has it all. For those looking for a challenge, hike from Ohanapcosh to Chinook Pass, gaining 3,532 feet along the way. Begin in the massive old-growth forest of the Ohanapecosh area and make your way north, passing old giants, countless raging waterfalls, and the Ohanapecosh River. Towards the end of your hike, you will enter the subalpine area of Tipsoo Lake and Chinook Pass.  PROTIP: Take two cars and park on opposite ends of the trail to cut your hiking time in half. ",Hiking,300.0,Adventurous,0,"The Ohanapecosh area is a beautiful landscape of old-growth trees, wildlife, and the clear blue waters of the Ohanapecosh River.

Hike to Kings Creek Falls,90 Minutes,"Summer, Fall",Lassen Volcanic National Park,CA,https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/hikekingscreekfalls.htm,The Kings Creek Falls trail leads to a large roaring waterfall draped in ferns and other green plants which thrive off the mist generated by the falls.,"Start: Kings Creek Falls Trailhead Round Trip Distance: 2.3 miles (3.7 km) loop Round Trip Time: 2 hours Terrain: Gradual 700 foot descent along Upper Cascades section; steep, narrow stone staircase for one-way, uphill return via Cascades Foot Trail. Elevation Start / Loss: 7,286 feet (2220m) / 486 ft (148 m) Season: Approximately June through October Stock Use: Stock are not permitted on the Cascades Foot section  Kings Creek Falls is partily open - park staff will continue with repairs.   Kings Creek Falls can be accessed via a loop or an out-and-back hike. The first half mile passes along Lower Kings Creek Meadow. The loop then begins to the left (clockwise) along the Upper Cascades section, which offers expansive vistas as it steadily descends towards Kings Creek Falls. A fenced overlook provides a clear view of the 30-foot waterfall. Hikers can return to the trailhead on the same Upper Cascades section or loop back on the Cascades Foot section. Please travel uphill only on this narrow, steep section alongside the cascades to help improve your safety and the safety of others. How to Hike This Trail Safely Hiking the Kings Creek Fall Trail involves risk. Learn more about general hiking safely in this high elevation and remote park. Special considerations for this trail include:  Winter conditions can persist through the summer months, especially in the forested sections of the trail. Wear proper footwear and consider using trekking poles to help maintain balance.  Hiking at high elevation can aggravate preexisting medical conditions. Know the effects of altitude. Carry plenty of water, take breaks often, and do not exceed your abilities. Bears are occasionally sighted in this area. Learn more about how to be bear aware to protect yourself and wildlife. Traveling off-trail around the waterfall is strongly discouraged. For your safety, please stay behind the overlook railings. Snow melt significantly increases water flow in the spring season and increases the danger of drowning or being swept over the falls.

Hike the Sky–Bear Valley Loop,4-6 Hours,"Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall",Point Reyes National Seashore,CA,https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/hike-the-sky-bear-valley-loop.htm,"This varied hike takes you through dense forest, meadows, chaparral, and coastal grasslands, starting with an uphill climb on the east side of Inverness Ridge to a ridgetop with ocean views. Follow the forested ridgeline to the coastline, and return on a mostly flat trail through Bear Valley. This hike starts at the Bear Valley Trailhead, at the south end of the Bear Valley Parking Lot. Most of this hike's distance is within the Phillip Burton Wilderness.","Distance: 10.8 miles (17.4 km) total This varied hike takes you through dense forest, meadows, coastal scrub, and coastal grasslands, starting with an uphill climb on the east side of Inverness Ridge to a ridgetop with ocean views. Follow the forested ridgeline to the coastline, and return on a mostly flat trail through Bear Valley. This area was burned in 2020, when lightning strikes in the Woodward Valley started what became the Woodward Fire. Start at the Bear Valley Trailhead and follow the relatively flat Bear Valley Trail south. A short distance beyond a sign indicating you are entering the Phillip Burton Wilderness, you will get to choose between two routes that will lead you to the Sky Trail along the crest of Inverness Ridge.  Turn right on to the Mount Wittenberg Trail 0.2 miles (0.3 km) from the trailhead if you want a more strenuous ascent of about 1,130 feet (~340 m) over a distance of 1.8 miles (2.9 km). While the Woodward Fire burned along most of the length of the Mount Wittenberg Trail, it primarily burned in the understory and left most of the canopy of the Douglas fir forest intact. As a result, there are very few far-reaching views from this trail until you reach the ridge crest. Remain on the Mount Wittenberg Trail at the Z Ranch Trail junction, which is located at the highest point along this route with an elevation of 1270 feet (385 m).* From the crest of Inverness Ridge along the western 0.4 mile-long (0.6-kilometer-long) leg of the Mount Wittenberg Trail, you may be rewarded (weather dependent) with views looking west across the peninsula to the Pacific Ocean. The Mount Wittenberg Trail intersects with the Sky Trail 0.4 miles (0.6 km) beyond the Z Ranch Trail junction and 2.4 miles (3.8 km) from the Bear Valley Trailhead. *From Mount Wittenberg–Z Ranch Trail junction, the 0.3-mile-long (0.5-kilometer-long) Mount Wittenberg Summit Trail leads, as its name suggests, to the summit of Mount Wittenberg (elevation 1407 feet (426 m). The once unobstructed views from near the summit have, since 2000, become obstructed by dense Douglas fir thickets that sprouted shortly after the 1995 Vision Fire. While the 2020 Woodward Fire burned through much of the forest around Mount Wittenberg, the view-obstructing Douglas fir thickets were largely left unscathed. So, without being rewarded with views for their effort, many hikers pass on ascending the Mount Wittenberg Summit Trail. Turn right on to the Meadow Trail 0.8 miles (1.3 km) from the trailhead if you want a slightly easier climb over Inverness Ridge. Similar to the Mount Wittenberg Trail, the Woodward Fire mostly impacted the understory of the forest along the Meadow Trail. While the trail does pass through a fairly large meadow (after which the trail was named), views from the meadow are of forested hillsides less than a mile distant. The Meadow Trail ascends about 840 feet (~255 m) over a distance of 1.6 miles (2.6 km) before intersecting with the Sky Trail 2.4 miles (3.8 km) from the Bear Valley Trailhead. The elevation at this intersection is ~1080 feet (~327 m).  Both the Mount Wittenberg Trail and the Meadow Trail intersect the Sky Trail at the same large trail junction. Turn left (south) on to the Sky Trail and follow it for 3.9 miles (6.2 km) to its junction with the Coast Trail. Once hemmed in by a ~six-foot-tall (~two-meter-tall) hedge of huckleberry bushes, the Woodward Fire cleared out most of the shrubs and a lot of the lower branches of the trees in this area so that this section of trail feels a bit more open than it did before 2020. And, as a result of the fire, there are many more far-reaching views from the Sky Trail. Turning south on to the Coast Trail leads in 0.5 miles (0.8 km ) to the Coast Trail-Bear Valley Trail junction. Turn left on to the Bear Valley Trail and follow it 4 miles (6.4 km) east and north back to the Bear Valley Trailhead parking lot. The Bear Valley Trail has a gentle grade as it first follows Coast Creek to Divide Meadow and then gradually descends along Bear Valley Creek for the final 1.6 miles (2.6 km) of this hike. The trail passes through a beautiful forest of buckeyes, oaks, and Douglas firs, aside from the large meadow at Divide Meadow. Restrooms and water are available at the Bear Valley Trailhead parking lot. Otherwise, there are no other facilities along this route until you reach Divide Meadow, at which there are vault toilets, but no potable water.

One can either start at the Muddy Hollow Trailhead at the trail's north end and hike to and from Limantour Beach, or start at trail's southern terminous at the Limantour Beach Trailhead and hike north and up the Muddy Hollow drainage. Beginning at the Muddy Hollow Trailhead, follow the path downstream through lush riparian habitat of red alder and willow. After 1.4 miles (2.2 km), one arrives at a pond, which is a good location for birding. The next 0.4 miles (0.7 km) of trail skirts along the southern edge of an arm of Estero de Limantour before eventually arrive at the picnic area just south of Limantour Beach parking lot. Vault toilets are available at this location. From here, you can continue for ~0.2 miles (~350 meters) to the edge of Drakes Bay at Limantour Beach. Retrace your route back when you are ready. Alternatively, some prefer to start their hike by parking at the Limantour Beach lot and following the Muddy Hollow Trail north from the Limantour Beach Trailhead. This offers the possibility of relax at the beach upon one's return. To find the southern end of the Muddy Hollow Trail from the large gravel parking lot at Limantour Beach, follow the path from the southern end of the parking lot past the vault toilets, keeping to the right.

One can either start at the Muddy Hollow Trailhead at the trail's north end and hike to and from Limantour Beach, or start at trail's southern terminous at the Limantour Beach Trailhead and hike north and up the Muddy Hollow drainage. Beginning at the Muddy Hollow Trailhead, follow the path downstream through lush riparian habitat of red alder and willow. After 1.4 miles (2.2 km), one arrives at a pond, which is a good location for birding. The next 0.4 miles (0.7 km) of trail skirts along the southern edge of an arm of Estero de Limantour before eventually arrive at the picnic area just south of Limantour Beach parking lot. Vault toilets are available at this location. From here, you can continue for ~0.2 miles (~350 meters) to the edge of Drakes Bay at Limantour Beach. Retrace your route back when you are ready. Alternatively, some prefer to start their hike by parking at the Limantour Beach lot and following the Muddy Hollow Trail north from the Limantour Beach Trailhead. This offers the possibility of relax at the beach upon one's return. To find the southern end of the Muddy Hollow Trail from the large gravel parking lot at Limantour Beach, follow the path from the southern end of the parking lot past the vault toilets, keeping to the right.

Allow 25 minutes driving time from Bear Valley to the Estero Trailhead.","Distances: To the footbridge: 2.4 miles (3.8 km) roundtrip To Sunset Beach Trail Junction: 5 miles (8 km) To Sunset Beach: 7.8 miles (12.6 km) roundtrip To Drakes Head: 8.8 miles (14.2 km) roundtrip This trail through grassland and cattle pastures offers outstanding views of Drakes Estero and Estero de Limantour, and the opportunity to see the diverse wildlife that call these ecosystems home. From the Estero Trailhead at its northwestern end, the Estero Trail heads south through brush-spotted grasslands for 0.6 miles (1 km). The trail then skirts along the northern edge of an abandoned Christmas tree farm before turning south to pass among the Monterey pines. Keep your eyes and ears open for owls. After another 0.6 miles (1 km), the trail arrives at Home Bay, the head of which was dammed by ranchers to create a stock pond. More recently, the dam was breached and the trail now traverses along the crest of the earthen dam. A footbridge with benches was constructed at the location of the breach. The bridge is a great location to look for birds—egrets and herons roost and nest in the pines and shorebirds and waterfowl abound in the estero (which is Spanish for estuary). One may also observe bat rays and leopard sharks in the water below the bridge. The bridge is also a good turn-around point for those wanting a shorter hike. From Home Bay, the trail leads up and over a couple of small ridges through pastureland. Please be respectful of grazing stock and be sure to leave gates as you find them: if they are closed, please close them after passing through. Between the ridges are valleys in which stock ponds were constructed by ranchers. These ponds attract a variety of waterfowl. The Sunset Beach Trail branches off to the right 1.4 miles (2.3 km) south of the bridge. Some hikers turn around here for a 5-mile (8 km) round-trip hike. Follow Sunset Beach Trail for an additional 1.4 miles (2.3 km) to get to Sunset Beach—which is arguably more of a marshy wetland, rather than a beach. Alternatively, turn left to stay on the Estero Trail as it heads up a ridge away from Drakes Estero. The last couple sections of the route seems more like a cattle trail than a hiking trail, but persevere and look for markers to differentiate between the cattle paths and the hiking trail. After 0.6 miles (1 km), turn right on to the Drakes Head Trail at the junction of a number of fencelines adjacent to a small corral and abandoned, circular, concrete water trough. There will be abundant views of Estero de Limantour to the east as one heads south 1.3 miles (2 km) south to Drakes Head. The view looking down into the estero on a clear day is truly spectacular, with the possibility of seeing bat rays and leopard sharks swimming just below the water's surface. If you want to continue east along the Estero Trail, you will get to explore sections of the Phillip Burton Wilderness where you may be the only hiker.

Both Island in the Sky and The Needles provide ample opportunities for short walks, day hikes and backpacking trips. Due to its remoteness, The Maze is primarily a backpacking destination. Trails are usually marked with cairns (small rock piles) and may have signs at intersections. Many remote trails do not receive regular maintenance and may not be adequately marked. All backcountry hikers should carry a topographic map.  Island in the Sky Trails Several short trails explore the mesa top with minimal elevation change, enjoying canyon views from above. Moderate trails involve elevation, such as climbing a sandstone feature or descending partway into a canyon. Long trails at Island in the Sky begin on the mesa top and descend via switchbacks to the White Rim bench, or beyond to one of the rivers. All are considered strenuous, with an elevation change of 1,000-2,000 feet (300-600 m) and require negotiating steep slopes of loose rock as well as sections of deep sand. All trails are marked with cairns (small rock piles). Water is scarce; bring at least 1 quart (1 L) of water per person for short trails, and up to 1 gallon (4 L) for long trails. Avoid hiking during peak heat on summer days. Carry a flashlight, map, and basic first aid equipment. Download maps here. The Needles Trails The Needles offers over 60 miles of interconnecting trails as challenging as they are rewarding. Many different itineraries are possible, but some of the more popular ones are listed below. Four short, self-guided trails along the paved scenic drive highlight different aspects of the park's natural and cultural history. Surfaces can be uneven. Trail guides are available at the visitor center and at the trailheads. Conditions of other trails are more primitive, traversing a mixture of slickrock benches and sandy washes. Longer trails are especially rough and require negotiating steep passes with drop-offs, narrow spots, or ladders. Water in the backcountry is unreliable and scarce in some areas. Trails are marked with cairns (small rock piles). Although most trails can be hiked in a day by strong hikers, many form loops and may be combined with other trails for longer trips. Net elevation change is generally several hundred feet or less, except for the Lower Red Lake Trail, which drops 1,400 feet to the Colorado River. Download maps here.

Each year, park rangers respond to hundreds of search and rescue incidents (SARs). It can take hours to locate and extract injured individuals. We want your trip to Canyonlands to be safe and enjoyable. Below are some of the potential hazards you may experience during your visit. Please become familiar with them, and keep them in mind while you're here.       NPS Graphic / Veronica Verdin Heat and Sun During the summer, expect high temperatures, intense sunlight and low humidity. Eat plenty of food and drink at least one gallon (4 L) of water each day. Carry and drink water while you are engaged in any activity in the park, such as hiking. Wear loose-fitting, light-colored clothing and a wide-brimmed hat. Apply sunscreen to all exposed skin. Consider saving strenuous activity for early mornings or evenings. Read more about weather conditions. Water Hydration is essential in the desert, even in winter. Drink 1 gallon (4 L) of water per day. Water filling stations are limited in the park. Here's where you can find drinking water:   Island in the Sky Visitor Center - year-round  The Needles Visitor Center - year-round The Needles Campground - spring through fall  There is no drinking water at the Island in the Sky campground or anywhere at The Maze. Plan on bringing your own water or filtering water in the backcountry. Area Services Canyonlands is an isolated and rugged environment. You may have to drive more than 50 miles (80 km) to find food, gas, lodging, or medical facilities, particularly from The Needles or The Maze. Make sure you have plenty of fuel before driving to Canyonlands. Do not rely on cellular telephones; there are many areas where they will not work. Climbing and Scrambling Be careful near cliff edges, especially when conditions are wet or icy. Avoid loose rock when traversing slopes, and remember that slickrock is much easier to climb up than down. Staying Found Stay with companions while hiking; separation can mean getting lost. Do not count on a cellular phone to summon help; service will not reach into many areas of Canyonlands. If you become lost, stay where you are, and wait for rescue. Wandering will endanger your life and make finding you difficult. When traveling alone, always tell someone where you are going and when you expect to return. Do not rely on GPS units to guide you into the park. Wildlife Wild animals often carry deadly diseases, including hantavirus, bubonic plague and rabies. They may become aggressive without warning. Always view wildlife from the safety of your car or from a distance. Do not approach animals to take photographs, and teach children not to chase or pick up animals. A few venomous animals live in the park, including midget-faded rattlesnakes, scorpions, and black widow spiders. It's unlikely that you'll see these animals. If you do, they will generally flee when approached. While a scorpion sting is likely to be mild (like a bee sting), anyone bitten by a black widow spider or rattlesnake should seek medical attention as soon as possible. Black bears are known to wander into the park from the Abajo Mountains, which border The Needles district. They have been sighted in Salt Creek Canyon and many neighboring canyons, as well as along the Colorado River. Backpackers in some of these areas may need bear canisters. Lightning and Flash Floods Storms and flash floods can be powerful and sudden. When lightning is present, there is no safe place outside. Return to your vehicle, or get indoors. If you can't get indoors, avoid lone trees, cliff edges, and high ridges. Crouch low to the ground. Never try to cross a wash that is flooding. Winter Travel Winter temperatures can drop well below freezing. Hypothermia is a hazard in late fall, winter and early spring. When hiking during these times, carry extra layers of clothing, foul-weather gear and a flashlight. Be prepared to spend the night out if necessary. Even a few inches of snow can hide cairns and trails, or make slickrock areas impassable. Read more about visiting in winter.

Both Island in the Sky and The Needles provide ample opportunities for short walks, day hikes and backpacking trips. Due to its remoteness, The Maze is primarily a backpacking destination. Trails are usually marked with cairns (small rock piles) and may have signs at intersections. Many remote trails do not receive regular maintenance and may not be adequately marked. All backcountry hikers should carry a topographic map.  Island in the Sky Trails Several short trails explore the mesa top with minimal elevation change, enjoying canyon views from above. Moderate trails involve elevation, such as climbing a sandstone feature or descending partway into a canyon. Long trails at Island in the Sky begin on the mesa top and descend via switchbacks to the White Rim bench, or beyond to one of the rivers. All are considered strenuous, with an elevation change of 1,000-2,000 feet (300-600 m) and require negotiating steep slopes of loose rock as well as sections of deep sand. All trails are marked with cairns (small rock piles). Water is scarce; bring at least 1 quart (1 L) of water per person for short trails, and up to 1 gallon (4 L) for long trails. Avoid hiking during peak heat on summer days. Carry a flashlight, map, and basic first aid equipment. Download maps here. The Needles Trails The Needles offers over 60 miles of interconnecting trails as challenging as they are rewarding. Many different itineraries are possible, but some of the more popular ones are listed below. Four short, self-guided trails along the paved scenic drive highlight different aspects of the park's natural and cultural history. Surfaces can be uneven.

This is a High Elevation Park With most of the park at 8,000 feet (2,438 m) or above, elevation is a very real factor to consider when choosing your hike. At this elevation, there's about 70% of the oxygen available at sea-level, and you'll certainly feel it if you begin to hike. When you're choosing a hike, do yourself a huge favor and don't choose something at the edge of your abilities. Take it easy, and rest assured that even short hikes have as much beauty to offer as the longest ones. Elevation-related injuries, such as heart issues, are among the park's most common medical emergencies.  UV radiation is also a lot stronger at this elevation. Make sure you cover up, wear sunscreen, or take other precautions to protect your skin and eyes.  Lastly, storms can form quickly here. If thunder roars, go indoors! Lightning--especially during the summer monsoon season--is a deadly threat. Take shelter in your vehicle, a building, a shuttle bus, or if you're on a trail find a low lying depression. Both trees and hoodoos can conduct lightning down to you. Water and Footwear With less oxygen available in each breath, you're going to be breathing harder, which means that you're going to dehydrate more quickly. We recommend a liter of water for every 1-2 hours you plan to hike. There is no water available once you're on a trail (backcountry hikes pass seasonal springs and drainages, but even these are rarely reliable), so make sure you pack all that you need.   Our number one cause of injuries in the park? Bad footwear. Trails have a lot of small, loose rock on their otherwise flat surfaces making slipping and twisting an ankle all too easy. Footwear with a good tread and ankle support is highly recommended. In winter, ice creates even more hazardous conditions.

Parking: Main Parking Lot by Visitor Center. Closest Restroom: Old Point Loma Lighthouse Grounds.  Route: This trail follows an old military road that winds down from the top of the park toward San Diego Bay. After reaching the bottom, you return to the trailhead by retracing your steps back up the trail. The trail begins on as an asphalt road and turns off the road onto a dirt and gravel path part way down. There is no access to the beach at any point on the trail   Safety: There are no restrooms or water sources along this trail. Hikers should plan to bring water and sun protection, especially during the warm summer months. As in any natural area, there are environmental hazards to watch out for, including toxic plants, animals (such as rattlesnakes), and fragile cliff faces. Bayside Beauty The Bayside Trail has great views of the ocean, native wildlife, and the city of San Diego. On a clear day you can see the mountains of Mexico to the south, the Laguna mountains to the east behind the San Diego skyline, Naval Air Station North Island, and the Coronado Bridge. Benches and stopping points provide a chance to catch your breath and take in some of the most beautiful views in San Diego county.  Exhibits along the trail explore topics such as native vegetation, animal life, the local climate, World War II history, etc. Along the trail you will also encounter a historic searchlight shelter and power plant used during World War I and World War II. Benches along the trail allow you to rest, reflect, and enjoy the view.   The downhill portion of the trail ends at an overlook of Ballast Point, where Cabrillo’s ships anchored after three months at sea in 1542. Today, nuclear-powered submarines are docked there, in the same place! Cabrillo’s statue looms on the bluff about 300 feet above this point. Climate, Plants, and Animals The natural environment along the trail is much the same as when Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo came ashore here in 1542. The trail is one of very few places in the world where Coastal Sage Scrub can live. Coastal sage habitat includes plants such as the fragrant black age and sagebrush and is one of the most threatened habitat types in the world. The trail is also home to the Southern Maritime Chaparral, another vulnerable and precious habitat, including cliff spurge, dudleya and barrel cactus. Point Loma gets approximately 10 inches of rain a year, so wildlife has adaptated to survive the relatively dry climate.  Hundreds of different native plants and animals call the Coastal Sage Scrub their home. Many local birds, such as the California Quail, American Kestrel, and Morning Dove might be seen along the trail. The Point Loma peninsula is an important stopover for many birds that use the Pacific Flyway. In the spring, migratory birds such as hummingbirds, warblers, wrentits, and bushtits make their appearance. Cottontail rabbits, ground squirrels, lizards, snakes, and foxes might be seen along the trail. During the summer, please keep an eye out for rattlesnakes.

In 1852, the U.S. Government designated the area as a military reserve. The Army housed a portion of its intricate coastal defense system on Point Loma.  During World Wars I and II cannons, mortars, and observation bunkers were constructed in a protective ring around the harbor. You’ll see a 1919 searchlight power station that was part of the system and housed huge searchlights that were used to light up the harbor entrance. The searchlight itself was housed a short way down the trail. When it was needed the soldiers wheeled it out on steel tracks, most of which have been removed. From there it could sweep the harbor entrance and illuminate approaching ships and aircraft.  From the tip of Zuniga Jetty, which you can see stretching from North Island southward toward the ocean, a submarine net anchored to Point Loma could be raised to prevent the entry of enemy underwater craft.  Today you can also see modern day military defense installations. At the end of the trail is a view of Ballast Point, home to nuclear-powered submarines.

During World Wars I and II cannons, mortars, and observation bunkers were constructed in a protective ring around the harbor. You’ll see a 1919 searchlight power station that was part of the system and housed huge searchlights that were used to light up the harbor entrance. The searchlight itself was housed a short way down the trail. When it was needed the soldiers wheeled it out on steel tracks, most of which have been removed. From there it could sweep the harbor entrance and illuminate approaching ships and aircraft.  From the tip of Zuniga Jetty, which you can see stretching from North Island southward toward the ocean, a submarine net anchored to Point Loma could be raised to prevent the entry of enemy underwater craft.  Today you can also see modern day military defense installations. At the end of the trail is a view of Ballast Point, home to nuclear-powered submarines. Across the bay you can see Naval Air Station North Island.",1,Chill
Coastal Trail,30-60 Minutes,"Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall",Cabrillo National Monument,CA,https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/coastal-trail.htm,Learn about hiking the Coastal Trail at Cabrillo National Monument!,"Length: 1 mi (1.6 km) round-trip Time: 30 minutes - 1 hour Difficulty: Easy (Trail is listed as a Class 5 trail at both ends with a Class 3 trail in the middle sections.) Elevation Change: 50 ft. (100 ft. if traveling to tidepools from Lot #2) Location: Cabrillo Road, bluffs overlooking the Tidepools Parking: Tidepool Lot #1 or Tidepool Lot #2 Closest Restroom: Pit Toilet at Tidepool Lot #1  Route: This dirt trail passes along the bluffs overlooking the Cabrillo Tidepools. This trail can be started from the entrances at Tidepool Lot #1 or #2. It is a 1/2 mile (0.8 km) trip from one lot to the other. Portions of the trail contain steps and there are a few steep slopes. A spur from this trail provides access to the tidepools during low tide events. To return to the trailhead, retrace your steps back the trail entrance you started from.  Directions: Once you are in the park, take the turnoff for Cabrillo Rd. and travel down the hill 1 mile (1.6 km) to reach Tidepool Lot #1. Additional parking is available 1/2 mile (0.8 km) further down the road at Tidepool Lot #2.   Safety: There are no water sources along this trail. Hikers should plan to bring water and sun protection, especially during the warm summer months. Beware of slippery terrain and waves when on the tidepool spur trail. As in any natural area, there are environmental hazards to watch out for, including toxic plants, animals (such as rattlesnakes), and fragile cliff faces. Coasting Along Cabrillo The Coastal Trail travels along the bluffs on the western side of Cabrillo, just above the tidepools. The path provides an amazing opportunity to take in views of the ocean, delicate bluffs, and the tidepools below (when exposed). The trail near Lot #1 branches in two directions. One portion heads down towards the tidepools while the main trail passes over a small hill and continues along the bluffs towards Lot #2. A spur trail just south of Lot #2 leads to a bluff with additional coastal views.  While much of the trail crosses barren badlands, there are ample opportunities to explore the area’s native plant life as well. At any point, you can look upslope to the east and see native Mediterranean Coastal Sage Scrub and Maritime Chaparral plants. This native vegetation was once abundant in southern California but development has left very little acreage remaining. You can also see a strand of rare Shaw’s Agave just south of Lot #2. You may see rangers and volunteers pulling invasive weeds in this area and working in other parts of the park. This work is invaluable in helping preserve the rare ecosystems found withing the park. For example, one recent project led to the resurgence of native sea dahlia!  There is an also opportunity to examine some World War II history during this hike. Near the top of the stairs towards Lot #2, you will come across Searchlight Shelter, No. 15, an underground structure from World War II. What you see from the trail is the sliding roof.

However, sometimes the weather does not cooperate. There is still so much to appreciate on days when the clouds roll in. Enjoy this list of park ranger favorites for days when the mountain isn’t out!  Mountain weather can be very dynamic and change rapidly. Mount Rainier is so large that it often creates its own weather! Always check with a park ranger at a visitor center to view the latest forecasts and to ask questions if you have any concerns. Be prepared by hiking with the 10 Essentials.  Remember, you can always check the Webcams page on the park website to see real-time weather conditions and visibility in the park. Stop and Listen Glacial-capped mountains like Mount Rainier are dynamic places – constantly changing. Cloudy days allow us to use other senses to experience these changes. Whether it is listening to boulders tumbling in glacial-fed rivers or hearing the ice shifting in our constantly moving glaciers, taking a moment to stop and listen can help you connect to the physical processes that continually shape Mount Rainier.

Go on a Day Hike at Coldwater Spring,,"Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall",Mississippi National River & Recreation Area,MN,https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/go-on-a-day-hike-at-coldwater-spring.htm,"Enjoy a nice day hike and many opportunities for wildlife viewing, photography, and reflection at Coldwater Spring! Trails surround a restored prairie oak savannah and wetlands in this culturally and historically significant gem that is open year-round.","Introduction Coldwater Spring was added to the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area in January 2010, with the goal of restoring the landscape to an oak savanna/prairie complex. An extensive renovation, which included the removal of twelve buildings and the restoration and seeding of twelve acres of prairie and one acre of wetlands, began in early 2011 and was largely completed by August 31, 2012. During the course of the restoration more than 1,000 trees, shrubs, grasses and wildflowers were planted on the property. The restoration work, however, will continue for many years. History This area served as an important crossroads for Native Americans and traders using both the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers for commerce and travel. During the construction of Fort Snelling U.S. soldiers camped at Coldwater Spring, making it the first American settlement in Minnesota. By 1825, construction of the fort had been completed and soldiers had moved from Coldwater into the fort. The area around the spring, however, continued to attract traders, Native Americans, and a small village developed that serviced the trade at the site. The spring also continued to provide water to the new fort and the later Upper Post. The fort initially relied on horse-drawn water wagons and eventually railcars to deliver water from Coldwater Spring up until the 1870s. By 1879, the fort was expanded under Secretary of War, Alexander Ramsey. The fort's expansion demanded a more efficient water supply system and, in 1880, the Army established a formal waterworks at the spring. Coldwater served as the water source for the Army until the 1920s when the Army turned to the City of Saint Paul to supply water for the fort.  The property was last home to the Bureau of Mines: Twin Cities Research Center. The buildings were constructed primarily during the late 1950's through the early 1960's.The Research Center developed significant mining safety equipment, mining technologies and mineral extraction processes used worldwide. The labs there also analyzed the composition of some of the moon rocks brought to Earth by the Apollo moonshot missions. Federal funding for the Bureau of Mines was permanently eliminated in 1996; by 1997 the buildings were vacated and gradually fell into disrepair. They remained vacant until their demolition in 2011. Activities The park features an ADA-compliant trail for walking to Coldwater Spring. Additionally, there are many opportunities for wildlife viewing and photography. Birdwatching is becoming a popular activity at Coldwater Spring as the savanna/prairie restoration matures and attracts a larger number of species. Turkeys, deer, and even coyotes are not uncommon and native wildflowers bloom throughout the growing season. Visitors can also learn about the extensive and fascinating history of Coldwater Spring through Ranger on Call, a mobile tour available on your cell phone. Additional Information    Dogs are welcome but must be on a leash no longer than 6 feet (2 meters) in length. Bicycles must be walked on the gravel trail from the parking lot past the spring house to the junction of the next trail to prevent rutting. WARNING: Water from the spring house and reservoir is not potable. Do not drink or use for personal consumption. Our tests indicate the water that runs from the spring's recharge area is not filtered sufficiently by natural processes to be safe for human consumption. We monitor the water discharge from both the springhouse and Wetland A weekly. See the water flow data we've collected.

This trail requires some planning about how you will access it. Hours can be spent on a summer's day relaxing on the banks of the Smith River.,"A Short Walk With An Adventure To Get There  These 300-foot trees are considerd by many as the heart of Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park. This majestic 44-acre grove of old-growth redwoods is a popular summer destination for those willing to take on the challenge of getting there.    The trail is a short 0.5 mile (0.8 km) in length and the grove is on the edge of the beautiful Smith River. A short spur trail decends down twenty feet to the Smith River. In summer many people picnic, paddle, and swim at this cobbled beach. In summer this is where the hikers' bridge crosses the Smith River.  Getting to and from this grove takes some time and effort and that is why we recommend this for two-hours.   Option1. Year round. Smaller vehicles like cars and vans can access the trailhead and parking lot by driving the eastern section of Howland Hill Road. Howland Hill Road is windy, narrow, mostly unpaved, and is not suitable for large vehicles. There is no parking for RVs and trailers at the trailhead.  Option 2.

As one of the parks most trafficked trails, people challenge their bodies and minds as they ascend this 450ft cliff trail and are rewarded with stunning views over Sand Beach, Thunder Hole, and the Gulf of Maine stretching to the horizon.    Distance:1.4 miles round trip.  Duration of hikes depend on your pace and if you stop and enjoy scenic areas. For an average pace, this hike takes 1 to 3 hours.   Safety:The trail is rocky and uneven. The first part of this trail ascends a 450-ft cliff with exposed edges. Steep drop offs with no railings require secure footings. Good foot wear is recommended.This trail is very dangerous in inclement weather. During rain events granite becomes extremely slippery. Allowing the rocks to dry provides a safer ascent.   ",0,Adventurous

Bike racks are available at all trailheads. Pets are not allowed on the trail. The Carbon River Ranger Station is located 5.5 miles east of the Mowich Lake (SR 165) junction.   Carbon River Rain Forest Nature Trail (0.25 miles roundtrip) – Rain forests seldom occur far from coastal areas, making the forest in this valley unique. Use this trail to explore the only true inland temperate rain forest at Mount Rainier. Starts at the Carbon River Entrance.   Old Mine Trail (2.9 miles roundtrip, 200 feet elevation gain) – Take a glimpse back in time by following this trail through the dense forest to peer into a gated mine entrance. Follow the Carbon River Trail for 1.2 miles, then take a steeper 0.25 mile spur trail to the mine entrance.   Green Lake Trail (10 miles roundtrip, 1300 feet elevation gain) – Green Lake is one of the park’s most serene mountain lakes. It is surrounded by forest but offers partial views to the south of Tolmie Peak. Follow the Carbon River Trail for 3.6 miles to Ranger Creek then take the Green Lake Trail.   Carbon Glacier Trail (17.5 miles roundtrip, 1900 feet elevation gain) – This is the best trail to experience a glacier firsthand. The trail follows the Carbon River through the forest to the terminus of the Carbon Glacier. Beware of rocks falling from the glacier terminus and do not approach the glacier; enjoy the view from the constructed trail. Follow the Carbon River Trail to Ipsut Creek Campground. For a quicker trip, bike the 5 miles (one-way) on the Carbon River Trail to the trailhead. Bikes are not allows on trails past the campground.

Situated among old-growth forest, White River serves as a gateway for climbers and campers alike. This campground offers 112 individual sites. Water and flush toilets available. Fires allowed only in designated areas. Located in White River Campground Loop C, the historic White River Patrol Cabin was built in the late 1920s and is part of a series of patrol cabins linked by trails that helped the early rangers protect the park. Exhibits tell the story of the around-the-mountain system of patrol cabins.   Emmons Moraine Trail (3 miles roundtrip, 700 feet elevation gain) – This trail leads along the Emmons Moraine to a view of the Emmons Glacier, the largest glacier in the lower 48 states.

Walk the trail to discover the grandeur and peace of this island. The Grove is just west of Stevens Canyon Entrance. Travel Tip: Grove of the Patriarchs has limited parking and is a very popular destination. Come early or start later in the day to find easier parking. Or, park at Ohanapecosh or along SR123 and hike to the Grove.   Eastside Trail (13.3 miles oneway, 3,532 feet elevation gain) – This extensive route connects the subalpine highlands of Chinook Pass and Tipsoo Lake with the deep, lowland forests of the Ohanapecosh area by following Chinook Creek and Ohanapecosh River drainages. Many hikers choose to begin at the trail’s upper end and complete the entire trail as a one-way, downhill trip from Chinook Pass to Ohanapecosh. However, trailheads provide access to the trail at several locations along its length, allowing day-hikers to enjoy shorter sections of the trail.   Stevens Canyon Road Season: Generally open June to late September. Travel Tip: Stevens Canyon Road is a popular summer route. Parking can be limited at pullouts and trailheads.

Box Canyon – From Stevens Canyon Entrance, drive 10.3 miles to the Box Canyon parking lot and picnic area. Take a short walk to the bridge and peer over, almost 180 feet below, to view the Muddy Fork of the Cowlitz River in a deep, slot canyon. Along the short loop trail pass by smooth polished rock that was sculpted by glaciers.   Reflection Lakes – From Box Canyon, drive and additional 7.3 miles and stop to view a set of subalpine lakes known for their ability to showcase Mount Rainier’s reflection. For additional fun, hike the High Lakes Loop Trail which climbs through meadows and offers rewarding views of both Louise Lake and Stevens Canyon. Begins at the Reflection Lakes parking lot.   Longmire Season: Open year-round. Travel Tip: If the main parking lots at Longmire fill up, additional parking can be found along the road and in front of the Longmire Community Building on the east side of the Nisqually River.With the establishment of Mount Rainier National Park in 1899, Longmire became the park headquarters. Although the headquarters are no longer located here, the original building still remains and the area houses many park facilities and staff. The site previously served as James Longmire’s homestead, lodging, and mineral springs resort.   Longmire Historic Walking Tour (1.25 miles roundtrip) – Observe the excellent examples of classic National Park Service rustic architecture found at Longmire.   Trail of the Shadows (0.7 mile loop) – An easy walk past one of the park’s earliest homesteads, the Longmire mineral springs, and through the surrounding forest.   Eagle Peak Trail (7.2 miles round trip, 2955 feet elevation gain) – A steep trail through oldgrowth forest with great views of Mount Rainier, Nisqually Glacier, and the Tatoosh Ranger. Trailhead found across the Longmire Suspension Bridge on the east side of the Nisqually River in Longmire.   Westside Road Season: Generally open May through November. Travel Tip: Parking is limited and there are no restroom facilities. The nearest restroom is at Kautz Creek, halfway between Longmire and Westside Road. Developed with hopes of completing an “around-the-mountain” network of roads, Westside Road is now partially closed to cars due to washouts from Tahoma Creek. Closed to vehicles after 3 miles at Dry Creek, the remaining 10 miles are open to hikers and bicyclists. Bicycles are not allowed on trails. There are bike racks at all trailheads. This former road serves as the gateway for numerous trailheads and historical landmarks for hikers and bicyclists looking to explore the western side of the park.   From Dry Creek, bike 3.8 miles to Round Pass, which serves as the starting point for the Lake George and Gobblers Knob trails.   Also located at Round Pass, the Marine Memorial is a monument dedicated to the 1946 airplane crash on the South Tahoma Glacier that claimed 32 lives.   From Round Pass, bike an additional 4 miles to the St. Andrews Patrol Cabin with a short loop trail to Denman Falls.   Or, bike the entirety of the former road for roughly 20 miles roundtrip.

This veranda is a pleasant place in the summer evenings when a cool breeze stirs along the river and blows in the faces of the tired men, who loll back in their rocking-chairs (what true American does not enjoy a rocking-chair?), book in hand--though they do not often read the books, but rock gently to and for, gazing sleepily out at the weird-looking buttes opposite, until their sharp outlines grow indistinct and purple in the after-glow of the sunset."" - From Hunting Trips of a Ranchman by Theodore Roosevelt.",0,Adventurous

There are countless opportunities to learn, explore, recreate, and enjoy Mount Rainier National Park here. Longmire has lots of historic buildings and scenic hiking trails. Stop at the historic Nisqually Bridge or the Trail of the Shadows to take in some history, or stretch your legs by hiking Rampart Ridge or Eagle Peak. This is a great place to visit year round. The National Park Inn is a nice place to take a break after a long drive, and the Longmire Museum provides information to visitors. Always check trail and road conditions with a park ranger or online before hiking. Many trails may be partially or totally covered in snow and can be dangerous. Roads may be closed due to snow conditions. Plan your day in Longmire by mixing and matching the options below.  Mountain Views Year-round and weather dependent. Trail of the Shadows (0.7 miles round-trip, 30 minutes) - Trail of the Shadows begins across the main park road from the Longmire Museum. A short spur trail will take you into the meadow and offer a view of the mountain. For your safety, do not drink the water from the springs!  Longmire Community Building (1 mile round-trip, 40 minutes) - Follow the side road towards all the buildings and through the employee housing area. The road will make two switchbacking turns before crossing the Nisqually River on a wooden suspension bridge. Cross the bridge and follow the road to the Community Building on the left. Enjoy the views of Mount Rainier!  Rampart Ridge (4.6 mile loop, 1339 feet elevation gain, 2.5 hours) - Beginning from the Trail of the Shadows, this is a steep loop trail traveling through forests with vistas from the top.  Waterfalls Carter Falls Trail (2.2 miles round-trip, 500 feet elevation gain, 2 hours) - The trail begins at the paved pullout 100 yards below Cougar Rock Campground. To add 1.4 miles one-way to the hike, start in Longmire rather than Cougar Rock Campground. Look for the Wonderland Trail sign in Longmire to start your hike.  Christine Falls - Located 4.5 miles east of Longmire. Use the pullout just beyond the stone bridge. The trail descends 100 feet to a view of Christine Falls framed by the bridge. For your safety, please don’t stop your car or walk on the bridge— drivers distracted by the scenery may hit you!  Historic Buildings  Longmire Historic Walking Tour - Follow the self-guided walking tour pamphlet to explore the National Park Service rustic architecture in Longmire. The pamphlet can also be picked up at the Longmire Museum.  Longmire Museum - Completed in 1928 and is now primarily used as a visitor center. However, many of the original exhibits are still on display. Administration Building - Built in 1928 and still stands as a treasured example of National Park Service Rustic architecture. National Park Inn - Opened in 1906 and is still enjoyed by guests today. Feel free to explore the inside and enjoy a meal at the restaurant.  Old-Growth Forest Twin Firs Trail (.4 mile loop, 15 minutes) Located 2 miles west of Longmire (towards the Nisqually Entrance). This short loop is a quick and easy opportunity to enjoy a beautiful old-growth forest and gaze up at towering giant trees.  Trail of the Shadows (0.7 miles round-trip, 30 minutes) - Trail of the Shadows begins across the main park road from the Longmire Museum.

Each puʻu represents a different erruption site, the youngest of which occured only about 1,000 years ago. Geologically speaking, thatʻs recent! Discover what makes the Hawaiian volcanoes stand out in our Geology Guide.  Life is harsh in this windy, sunny environment. The ʻāhinahina, or Haleakalā silversword, is a plant unique to Haleakalāʻs summit area. Its special adaptations allow this species to live where few can.

All About Hiking - Start Here!,,,Shenandoah National Park,VA,https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/shenandoah-hiking.htm,"With over 500 miles of trails in Shenandoah National Park, chances are high that you'll be lacing up your hiking boots at some point on your next trip here.","With over 500 miles of trails in Shenandoah National Park, chances are high that you'll be lacing up your hiking boots at some point on your next trip here. As with any outdoor activity, there are a few things to know that will help keep you, your loved ones, and the wildlife that you may encounter safe. Once you look over these tips, head on over to the Day Hikes section on the home page of the app to find a list of suggested hikes. 1. Get a Map & Know Trail Markers Be sure that you know your hiking route before you get out on the trail, and bring a trail map of the area where you'll be hiking. A compass and a GPS unit can also help to keep you on track.  Shenandoah's trails are well-marked, but it's important to know what to look for. Trail markers are cement posts found at trailheads and trail intersections. The metal bands on them will show you what trail you are on, what other trails converge at that intersection, and the mileages to other points of interest. You will also see trail blazes painted on trees and rocks along the trail. The color of the paint indicates the type of trail that you are on: Blue - hiking trail White - Appalachian Trail Yellow - hiking trail that is also open to horses 2. Bring Plenty of Water Did you know that the average person drinks one quart of water per hour while hiking on a hot day? It's important to plan ahead and bring plenty of water for everyone in your group, including pets! 3. Don't Skip the Snacks Plan on bringing one snack per person, per hour. Salty snacks can help you to replace lost electrolytes. 4. Communicate Cell service is unreliable in Shenandoah, so be sure to let a friend or family member know where you plan to hike and when to expect your return. 5. Pack a First Aid Kit Slips, trips and falls can happen at any time, but having a basic first aid kit can help. Observing the following guidelines can minimize the likelihood that you'll need to use it:  Watch your step and be prepared to turn around in dangerous settings such as a wet and slippery conditions, high-water crossings, or ice on the trail. Never walk around the top of a waterfall - wet rocks are surprisingly slippery and many people have been injured, some fatally. Be sure to always stay on Park-maintained trails.  6. Check the Weather Always check the weather forecast and be prepared for changing conditions. Remember, temperatures on the mountain can be 10 to 20 degrees cooler than in the valley. 7. Wear Appropriate Clothing Wear proper, sturdy footwear when hiking on any unpaved trail. Layer your clothing and bring a rain jacket so that you're ready for any weather. 8. Carry a Flashlight Even if you plan on finishing your hike before dark, having a flashlight with fresh batteries is a good idea. Cell phones don't make reliable flashlights.  9. Don't Forget a Whistle A whistle is a great way to alert someone to your location, if necessary. Check to see if your hiking backpack as one built into the chest strap! 10. Plan for Emergencies Play the ""What If?"" game, and know what to do if an emergency arises.    You Might Also Want to Know About...   Poison Ivy Poison ivy grows plentifully along roadsides, trails, and the edges of parking lots as a vine or a low shrub. Most people are sensitive in varying degrees to the sap of this plant, which makes skin itch, blister, and swell. Because of this, it's important to learn to identify it so that you can avoid it if you see it out in the Park. If it does touch your skin, wash the area with soap and water as soon as possible, as the sap can penetrate your skin in only a few minutes. Valuable Property While hiking, take valuables with you or leave them locked in your vehicle, hidden from view. Hunting No hunting is allowed inside Shenandoah National Park, however several trails and gravel roads connect Shenandoah to the Rapidan Wildlife Management Area and private property where hunting is allowed.

Children and family members with a reasonable amount of physical fitness can enjoy the walk to the overlook. Once you’re at the top, look down at the parking lot and take pride in how far you’ve hiked. Enjoy the sweeping views in every direction. From this vantage point you can see into three other states—South Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee.  The paved trail starts from the Devils Courthouse Overlook at Milepost 422 on the Parkway. The climb up the moderate to strenuous trail is worth the view from the overlook at the top. The first portion of the trail is paved.  The hike is only 0.5 miles to the top, but it's a steep climb. There are places to stop and rest along the way. Wear sturdy shoes and bring a light jacket. It can be windy up top.  The surrounding red spruce and Fraser fir forest is a unique ecosystem that is a relic from the last ice age dating back over 10,000 years ago. Glaciers didn't come this far south, but temperatures were cooler. Species that could tolerate and thrive in cold temperatures survived farther south than they typically do now. Tiny fragments of these forests remain today on high mountain peaks due to their cooler and moister environments. Hiking the trail at Devils Courthouse is like hiking in the boreal forests of Canada.  Toward the end of the trail, a connector trail to the Mountains-to-Sea Trail breaks off to the left. To continue to the overlook, keep right. At the top, the forest gives way to a rocky outcrop and the overlook at the very top. On a clear day, this viewpoint allows a panoramic vista of the surrounding mountains and the valley below Devils Courthouse.

The Union Advance Trail at Antietam,30-90 Minutes,"Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall",Antietam National Battlefield,MD,https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/the-union-advance-trail-at-antietam.htm,Hike the Union Advance Trail to learn about the fighting around the famous Burnside Bridge.,"The Union Advance Trail starts at Auto Tour Stop 9. The trail crosses Burnside Bridge (also known as the Rohrbach or Lower Bridge) and makes a loop on the east side of Antietam Creek. The trail is one mile in length and should take about an hour to complete. The trail is easy except for two hills. However, the surface can be slightly uneven, so good walking shoes are recommended. You will be exploring the area where the Confederates defended the Burnside Bridge, and then crossing over Antietam Creek to see where the Union Ninth Corps, commanded by Gen. Ambrose Burnside, made their advances to capture the bridge. To get the full story of all of the fighting on the south end of the battlefield, this hike is best combined with the Final Attack Trail.  Hike Description and Interpretation The Confederate Defense It was Confederate Gen. D.R. Jones's division who defended the right flank of Lee's line. Here, the Confederates had the terrain advantage, however, they were terribly outnumbered. Jones’s Division numbered about 3,300, Burnside had available close to 12,000. The bridge crossing itself was secured by Gen. Robert Toombs small brigade of about 500 soldiers. Toombs placed the 2nd and 20th Georgia Infantry at the bridge. The rest of his small command spread out along the hill sides up and down stream where they poured their fire into Burnside’s men as they approached the bridge.  Directions: Walk across the Burnside Bridge and turn left (north) and follow the trail along the stone wall to Stop 1.  Stop 1 - Union Plan of Attack At 10:00 a.m., as the fighting raged at the Sunken Road, Burnside received orders to commence his attack against the bridge. Burnside sent Gen. Isaac Rodman with 3,200 soldiers downstream where they were to cross Antietam Creek and outflank the Confederates.  While Rodman’s men moved south, Burnside ordered diversionary attacks against the bridge. Over the course of the next three hours, at least three separate attacks were launched against the bridge, each one resulting in heavy loss.   Directions: Follow the trail up to the right, turning south to Stop 2. As you face the Burnside Bridge, you are looking west-southwest and are standing in the center of the three Union attacks on the bridge.   Stop 2 - Burnside Bridge Overlook The first attack was led by the 11th Connecticut Infantry followed by Crook’s Brigade. Crook mistakenly advanced upstream and was pinned down by Confederate fire. The 11th Connecticut pushed towards the bridge from the left. This uncoordinated first assault was just one example of how confusion, difficult terrain, and Confederate firepower broke down the Union attacks. The second attack on the bridge also came from the left. General Nagle’s Brigade was ordered forward at 11:00 a.m. and they were also turned back by incoming Confederate fire. Brig. Gen. Edward Ferrero’s veteran brigade was selected for the third, and eventually successful, attack on the bridge. The 51st New York and the 51st Pennsylvania Infantry Regiments with about 650 men charged right down the hill towards the bridge. At first the Confederate resistance was still strong enough to force them to a halt, but with ammunition running low and Rodman’s men finally crossing downstream, Toomb’s men retreated and Union soldiers finally captured this crucial Antietam crossing.  Directions: Continue on the trail along the edge of the field, back into the woods to Stop 3.  Stop 3 - 11th Connecticut Monument This monument to the 11th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry was dedicated on October 8, 1894. Veterans of a difficult and costly charge at Antietam returned thirty- two years later to memorialize their fallen comrades. Colonel Henry Walter Kingsbury and the men of the 11th Connecticut led the first attack on the bridge at 10:00a.m. Kingsbury, Confederate General D.R.Jones’s brother-in-law, urged his men on, until he was shot down by what Pvt. Tillinghast of Company D described as “the hottest fire we ever received.” Fighting desperately, the 11th CT made a gallant effort, but after losing a third of their men, including their commander, the Connecticut soldiers fell back.  Directions: Backtrack on the trail and continue toward the fence and historic road that parallels the creek.  Stop 4 - Fence Opening It was through this fence, along the stream, and up the road towards the bridge that many of Burnside's men charged, only to be shot down by the Confederates on the high ground on the other side of Antietam Creek.  Directions: Walk towards the Bridge for stop 5. Then finish the trail  by crossing the historic bridge and head up the hill back to your car.  Stop 5 - The Burnside Bridge Known as the Rohrbach Bridge before the battle, the bridge was designed and built by John Weaver at a cost of $2,300. It was completed in 1836 and was actively used for traffic until 1966. In an effort to preserve the bridge, a bypass was built to take cars on to a new bridge upstream. Today, visitors can once again quietly stroll across what has become the icon of Antietam Battlefield. The peaceful, bucolic setting belies the terrible struggle that took place where you have just walked.",Hiking,60.0,Chill,0,"The Union Advance Trail starts at Auto Tour Stop 9. The trail crosses Burnside Bridge (also known as the Rohrbach or Lower Bridge) and makes a loop on the east side of Antietam Creek. The trail is one mile in length and should take about an hour to complete. The trail is easy except for two hills. However, the surface can be slightly uneven, so good walking shoes are recommended. You will be exploring the area where the Confederates defended the Burnside Bridge, and then crossing over Antietam Creek to see where the Union Ninth Corps, commanded by Gen. Ambrose Burnside, made their advances to capture the bridge. To get the full story of all of the fighting on the south end of the battlefield, this hike is best combined with the Final Attack Trail.  Hike Description and Interpretation The Confederate Defense It was Confederate Gen. D.R. Jones's division who defended the right flank of Lee's line. Here, the Confederates had the terrain advantage, however, they were terribly outnumbered. Jones’s Division numbered about 3,300, Burnside had available close to 12,000. The bridge crossing itself was secured by Gen. Robert Toombs small brigade of about 500 soldiers. Toombs placed the 2nd and 20th Georgia Infantry at the bridge. The rest of his small command spread out along the hill sides up and down stream where they poured their fire into Burnside’s men as they approached the bridge.  Directions: Walk across the Burnside Bridge and turn left (north) and follow the trail along the stone wall to Stop 1.  Stop 1 - Union Plan of Attack At 10:00 a.m., as the fighting raged at the Sunken Road, Burnside received orders to commence his attack against the bridge. Burnside sent Gen. Isaac Rodman with 3,200 soldiers downstream where they were to cross Antietam Creek and outflank the Confederates.  While Rodman’s men moved south, Burnside ordered diversionary attacks against the bridge. Over the course of the next three hours, at least three separate attacks were launched against the bridge, each one resulting in heavy loss.   Directions: Follow the trail up to the right, turning south to Stop 2. As you face the Burnside Bridge, you are looking west-southwest and are standing in the center of the three Union attacks on the bridge.   Stop 2 - Burnside Bridge Overlook The first attack was led by the 11th Connecticut Infantry followed by Crook’s Brigade. Crook mistakenly advanced upstream and was pinned down by Confederate fire. The 11th Connecticut pushed towards the bridge from the left. This uncoordinated first assault was just one example of how confusion, difficult terrain, and Confederate firepower broke down the Union attacks. The second attack on the bridge also came from the left. General Nagle’s Brigade was ordered forward at 11:00 a.m. and they were also turned back by incoming Confederate fire. Brig. Gen. Edward Ferrero’s veteran brigade was selected for the third, and eventually successful, attack on the bridge. The 51st New York and the 51st Pennsylvania Infantry Regiments with about 650 men charged right down the hill towards the bridge. At first the Confederate resistance was still strong enough to force them to a halt, but with ammunition running low and Rodman’s men finally crossing downstream, Toomb’s men retreated and Union soldiers finally captured this crucial Antietam crossing.

Roanoke River Trail is an an easy trail that covers less than a mile. It makes a perfect leg stretcher hike as you pass through Roanoke.","The Roanoke River Trail is a 0.35 mile easy hike starts at an overlook before descending towards the Roanoke River. From this trail you can either take the Fisherman’s Trail down to the Roanoke River, head to a stone pedestrian overlook for a great view the river, or hike on the looped trail that takes you under the Roanoke River Bridge. All trails offer splendid views of the water.  The overlook sets the scene with a view of the river and nearby Niagara Dam. Immediately the trail begins its downward descent transitioning from a paved to more traditional path. Along the way, there are plenty of opportunities for photos of the dam and river from the side of the cliff. The parkway bridge that passes over the river is hard to miss. At this point the trail is about 50’ under the bridge.   Just before crossing under the bridge, the pathway forks. Taking the path to the left will lead you down to the water, another 80’ down. This is appropriately called the Fisherman’s Trail. Along this short path, which turns into a series of stairs, there is a wayside that talks about the Niagara Power Plant, the smallest hydroelectric plant in the American Electric Power System. Along the way are also a couple of benches which can provide needed breaks. The water is too rough for swimming, but fishing is allowed with a valid license.   Most people hiking the loop will want to go under the bridge, and from there you have a choice of where to go. Stay on the main trail to complete the loop, or head out the small diverging path to view the water from a pedestrian overlook. This quaint stone structure looks out over the river from a different vantage point than those offered along the trail. Visitors who are looking for a slightly longer walk may feel inclined to walk to all three trails.  Benches along the trails provide pleasant spots to rest and enjoy the scenery.   Is it worth driving out your way to experience Roanoke River Trail? Maybe not. But if you are in the area, it is a pleasant way to get some exercise without committing an entire afternoon to the endeavor.

Hiking/Visiting with Pets,,"Winter, Spring, Fall",Death Valley National Park,"CA,NV",https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/hiking-visiting-with-pets.htm,"Due to the extreme weather, it is not usually a good idea to bring a pet to Death Valley if you want to do any exploring out of your vehicle. If you are traveling through the park with a pet, and want to know where they are allowed to go, this is where to find that info! Stick to the roads, developed areas, and campgrounds. Pets are not permitted in the Wilderness or out of the areas listed above.","Pets in the Park Although pets are welcome in Death Valley National Park, there are many restrictions for the safety of park resources, wildlife, other visitors, and even your pet. You may take your pet on roads and to developed areas such as campgrounds and picnic areas, but they must be restrained or kept on a leash no longer than 6 feet (2 m) at all times. Pets are not allowed inside most buildings or on trails (including the paved trail to Zabriskie Point). Do not leave your animal in your vehicle. These restrictions do not apply to service animals.   Pets can go (on a leash no longer than 6 feet):  along roads in campgrounds in picnic areas in other developed areas   Pets can NOT go (even if carried):  on trails in the Wilderness inside most buildings out of developed areas   Pets can have a negative impact on the park. Dogs in particular may scare or chase wildlife, pollute water sources and can become defensive and dangerous in strange surroundings. Domestic animals can spread diseases to wildlife, and vice versa. Pet owners are responsible for cleaning up their pet's feces and disposing of it properly. The desert can be a dangerous place for pets. Coyotes have been known to lure unsuspecting pets away, resulting the the death of the pet. Rattlesnakes may alert humans to keep a safe distance, but most pets are unaware of the danger. Spiny plants and hot, rough ground surfaces can be painful or damaging to your pet's bare foot pads. Desert heat and aridity can take a toll on pets and humans. Remember to always provide drinking water and never leave your pet alone in a closed vehicle, which can quickly become deadly hot. Walking your Pet in the Park Almost all national parks prohibit pets on trails and in the Wilderness, but pets are allowed on roads. Walking your dog along one of Death Valley's many scenic backcountry roads can be a rewarding alternative to trails, and in many cases provides similar scenery to that seen on trails.

Vehicles are restricted to traveling in only one direction, but hikers can choose to turn around at any time.   Titus Canyon Road: The hike up the narrows of Titus Canyon is one of the most popular in Death Valley and because it is on a dirt road you can bring your pet along. The first 1.5 miles (2.4 km) is the narrowest, but you can continue as far as you want along the road. This area boasts spectacular scenery and excellent native bighorn sheep habitat; make sure you keep your pet under tight control to avoid endangering these iconic animals.   Echo Canyon Road: Although the first part of this road is open desert, if you have a high-clearance, 2WD vehicle you can drive 3 miles (4.8 km) to the canyon mouth, then walk with your pet through the 2 mile (3.2 km) long canyon narrows to a natural arch.

Be prepared for sudden changes in weather conditions. Pack an extra layer of clothing that reflects the most extreme conditions you could encounter.  4) ILLUMINATION – Flashlight, lanterns, and headlamp Lighting is indispensable in the outdoors where no conventional light sources can be found. Items include flashlights, lanterns, and headlamps. Headlamps are the preferred light source because they are hands-free. Be sure to pack extra batteries.  5) FIRST-AID SUPPLIES – First Aid Kit Be prepared for emergencies by packing first-aid supplies with you. Start with a pre-made kit and modify it to fit your trip and your medical needs. Check the expiration date on all items and replace them as needed. Consider including an emergency guide in case you are faced with an unfamiliar medical emergency.  6) FIRE – Matches, lighter and fire starters Fire can be an emergency signal and a heat source for cooking and staying warm. Pack matches (preferably waterproof) and fire starters - items that catch fire quickly and sustain a flame (e.g. lighter). Familiarize yourself with the fire use regulations of your park before heading out.  7) REPAIR KIT AND TOOLS – Duct tape, knife, screwdriver, and scissors Carry a basic repair kit with you to help repair equipment.

Hike to Rattlesnake Lodge,1-3 Hours,"Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall",Blue Ridge Parkway,"NC,VA",https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/hike-to-rattlesnake-lodge.htm,Step back in time with a hike to historic Rattlesnake Lodge. This enjoyable hike through shaded woodlands is close to Asheville and takes you to the remains of an early1900’s mountain retreat.,"Rattlesnake Lodge is a great hike that is popular with locals because it is a short drive from Asheville and is not a long hike. It’s perfect if you’re looking for a shorter hike or if your time is limited. As a bonus, it's a historic site with remains of structures more than 100 years old that you can explore.  Dr. Chase Ambler built a home here in 1903 as a remote escape for his family. The cooler temperatures of the higher elevation and the outdoor lifestyle it offered made it an ideal location for the Amblers. Over the years, they added additional land, structures, and amenities to the property. It eventually totaled over 300 acres and became an interesting mix of rural functionality and city luxuries. While most of the buildings and property features have burned, crumbled, or been overtaken by nature, a careful observer can find evidence of the barn, a swimming pool, the lodge site, a tool shed, the spring house and cisterns, a caretaker’s cabin, the potato house, and a tennis court. A map of the site can be found at www.rattlesnakelodge.com.  Rattlesnake Lodge was aptly named as 41 rattlesnakes were said to have been killed in the first three years the Amblers were there. The snake skins were hung on the living room ceiling. Certainly an interesting decorating choice! Dr. Ambler was known to offer $5 to anyone who brought him a rattlesnake to add to his collection. Five dollars was big bucks in those days, so undoubtedly rattlesnakes from near and far were sacrificed for the reward. Please note that it is illegal to kill or harm snakes in the park now.  Notwithstanding his apparent lack of love for snakes, Dr. Ambler was a community leader and a conservationist. The horse trail through his property was extended all the way to Mount Mitchell and much of its route today is part of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail (MST). Dr. Ambler was the chairman of a committee that eventually became the Carolina Mountain Club, which today maintains much of the MST. He was a strong advocate for the Weeks Act of 1911 that protected the headwaters of rivers and watersheds and lead to the creation of national forests in the eastern U.S. like Pisgah National Forest. Dr. Ambler was also an early supporter of the creation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and there is a peak named Mount Ambler in the park to honor him. The Ambler family left a legacy at Rattlesnake Lodge and we are fortunate that we can visit a place that was so special to them. Hike Description  • From the Blue Ridge Parkway, park at the Tanbark Ridge Tunnel at Milepost 374.4. On the south side of the tunnel there are dirt pull-offs on both sides of the road for parking. The trail begins on the west side of the road next to a small cascading creek. Very quickly, the trail splits. Both trails are moderately steep, approximately 0.5 miles long, and connect to the Mountains-to-Sea Trail (MST) that runs through the Rattlesnake Lodge site. (Both trails are marked with blue blazes. The MST is marked with white blazes.) The left trail will bring you closer to the old lodge site. The right trail connects to the MST further north and closer to the potato house and the traveler’s “shack.” A good option is to take one of the trails up and the other down for a nice loop hike.  •  Because the long Mountains-to-Sea Trail passes through Rattlesnake Lodge, you can hike further on that trail for a longer hike. There is also a 0.2 mile spur trail up from the old spring house to what was the main water reservoir for the property.  •  Whatever trail you take to get to Rattlesnake Lodge, you’ll be hiking through a mid-elevation deciduous forest. (The lodge site is at approximately 3,700 feet). Colorful wildflowers dot the trail in the spring and summer. Poison ivy is also common, so stay on the trail! This wooded hike keeps you in the shade almost all of the time, but doesn’t provide many views. Unless you hike in winter, when the leafless trees allow for more long-range views.

Meant to preserve the ""wildest of the wild,"" wilderness areas have no roads and no development. They are often the last pieces of pristine wildlands that once stretched across the whole country. Managed to minimize evidence of human presence, trails are not marked with signs or blazes and are often only minimally maintained.

Hiking in wilderness areas often requires a higher level of skills and preparedness than other trails.   Wilderness rules include:  No campfires allowed Group size must be less than 10 Bicycles are not allowed   The Middle Prong Wilderness Area is nearly 8,000 acres of rugged terrain located within Pisgah National Forest south of Asheville. Designated in 1984, the Middle Prong has the Blue Ridge Parkway for part of its southern and western boundary. This proximity makes the Parkway an excellent jumping off point for wilderness hiking.   Park at the Rough Butt Bald Overlook at Milepost 425.4.

To others, wilderness can be a scary, inhospitable place that seems entirely inaccessible to them. And, of course, many fall somewhere in between those sentiments. The beauty of the Middle Prong Wilderness is that it can be explored on many different levels. The novice hiker can take a short stroll on the well-established Mountains-to-Sea Trail and get a taste of wilderness travel. An experienced hiker can test their mettle by plotting a longer route into the heart of the Middle Prong.  Either way, it's worth it.

The trail opens up along the way, giving visitors outstanding scenic views of the Buffalo River and the Ozark Mountains that surround it. The gem of the hike is Hemmed-in Hollow Falls. The picturesque Hemmed-in Hollow falls cascade nearly 210 feet over the rugged Ozark bluffs, making it the highest waterfall between the Rockies and the Appalachians. This waterfall only flows after a considerable amount of rain, so please be mindful of recent precipitation before you attempt this difficult hike. The Hemmed-in Hollow Trail is an extremely steep and strenuous trail that will humble even the most experienced hiker. Visitors will need to plan to take the entire day to hike this trail, due to the rough wilderness terrain. The Hemmed-in Hollow Trail intersects with many of the other trail systems in the Ponca Wilderness, creating multiple spur trails for the more adventurous hiker. The spur trails connect the Hemmed-in Hollow Trail with the Sneeds Creek Trail, Centerpoint Trail, Bench Trail, and Old River Trail. For this reason, it's essential to have a detailed topographic map of this area in order to avoid confusion at trail intersections in the Ponca Wilderness.

Moderate Hike to the Crater Edge,1-2 Hours,"Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall",Haleakalā National Park,HI,https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/moderate-hike-to-the-crater-edge.htm,Meander through native shrubland to glimpse rare forest birds and a variety of plants found only in Hawaiʻi.,"Hike to an overlook of both the Haleakalā crater and the Koʻolau Gap along the ridge of an erosional valley. Halemauʻu Trail makes its way through native shrubland to the edge of the crater and several specatular scenci viewpoints along the way. At 1.1 miles (1.8 km) the ridge drops away on both sides for an impressive overlook into a lush valley and the volcanic crater. Turn around here for a 2.2 mile (3.6 km) roundtrip hike. The rocky trail is not extremely steep up to this point, but hikers should be careful of loose or slick rocks.   On your way out there, be on the lookout for the endemic forest birds that frequent this native shrubland. For birding enthusiastists, the Bird Brochure helps identify some of the most common birds you might see on this hike.   While birds can come and go, you'll probably have excellent luck in finding some of the native plant species. Common shrubs like the ʻōhelo, pilo, and māmane line the first mile of this trail. For a complete guide, check out our Plant Brochure.  The trail continues beyond the overlook and quickly loses elevation over a series of switchbacks that bring hikers to the crater floor. If undertaking a longer hike beyond this first mile of the trail, be sure to have snacks, water, rain gear, and sun protection. The return hike from the crater floor is strenuous and gains 1400 feet (430 m) of elevation in a few miles. ",Hiking,90.0,Chill,0,"Hike to an overlook of both the Haleakalā crater and the Koʻolau Gap along the ridge of an erosional valley.
